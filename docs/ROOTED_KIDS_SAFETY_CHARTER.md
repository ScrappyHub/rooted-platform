# ROOTED – Kids Safety Charter (Parent-Facing)

Status: ✅ Canonical (Parent-Facing Summary)  
Audience: Parents, guardians, educators, caregivers  
Authority Chain:
ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md (Supreme Child Safety Clause)  
→ ROOTED_COMMUNITY_TRUST_LAW.md  
→ Kids Mode / Education Vertical Governance Docs  
→ This Charter

This Charter explains, in clear language, how ROOTED protects children
and what Kids Mode will and will not do.

If this file and the Constitution ever disagree, the Constitution wins.

---

## 1. Kids Safety Comes Before Everything

ROOTED is legally and technically designed so that:

> If child safety ever conflicts with revenue, growth, or convenience,  
> child safety wins — automatically, not optionally.

This is not a slogan. It is enforced by:

- GitHub governance files
- Database rules (RLS)
- Feature flags
- Admin audit logs

No one can “temporarily” ignore these rules to run a test or campaign.

---

## 2. Kids Mode Status Today

At ROOTED Community launch:

- Kids Mode UI is **PILOT OFF**:
  - No separate kids-facing app is public yet.
  - Kids Mode rules already exist in code and governance.
- This Charter describes how Kids Mode will work when it is turned on.

You can read this now to decide whether ROOTED aligns with your values
before future kids features go live.

## 3. What Kids Mode Will Show (When Enabled)

Kids Mode is a **view-only, safety-first experience**.

Children will be able to see:

- Pre-approved educational landmarks (farms, historic places, nature spots)
- Pre-approved kid-safe events (family days, farm tours, educational programs)
- Pre-approved kid-safe experiences (when applicable)
- Soft, age-appropriate visuals (icons, language, colors)

Kids Mode will **not** allow them to:

- Post content
- Upload photos or videos
- Start conversations
- Create events, spots, or listings

---

## 4. What Kids Mode Will Never Show

In Kids Mode, children will **never** see:

- Prices or payment screens
- “Book now”, “request quote”, or RFQ buttons
- Bids, bulk marketplace, or vendor dashboards
- Donations or fundraising prompts
- Open messaging or chat
- Adult comment threads or debates
- Political messaging or targeted campaigns

These are enforced as **platform laws**, not preferences.

---

## 5. How Parents Stay in Control

Kids Mode will require:

- An intentional entry action (you must turn it on)
- A clear visual indicator that Kids Mode is active
- A parent/guardian step (PIN or similar) to manage:

  - Which devices use Kids Mode
  - When Kids Mode is active
  - When to exit Kids Mode

Kids cannot silently exit Kids Mode and enter the adult experience
without going through a parent-facing flow.

---

## 6. Data & Privacy for Kids

When a child is using Kids Mode:

- We do not:
  - Build advertising profiles
  - Infer demographic, religious, or political traits
  - Sell or share their personal data
- We store the minimal data necessary to:
  - Keep them in the correct mode
  - Show appropriate content
  - Protect the platform from abuse

Any features involving accounts, names, or avatars will be governed by
strict consent rules at the adult/guardian level.

---

## 7. Sanctuaries, Animals & Hard Content Boundaries

ROOTED includes farms, sanctuaries, and real-world operations.

In Kids Mode:

- Animal sanctuaries and rescues may be shown as:
  - Educational, mission-first places
  - Volunteer and learning opportunities (through parents)
- Kids Mode will **not**:
  - Turn these into donation funnels targeting kids
  - Display graphic or disturbing content
  - Wrap vulnerable animals into manipulative campaigns

Any difficult or sensitive topics (e.g., food production realities) will be
handled age-appropriately and under adult control.

---

## 8. Community Uploads & Kids

- Community upload features (user-submitted spots, photos, etc.)
  are **globally gated** and currently disabled.
- Even when enabled for adults in the future:
  - Kids Mode will **not** allow uploads.
  - Kids Mode will show only pre-moderated, kids-safe items.
  - Kids Mode will not allow children to browse raw, unfiltered feeds.

Children will never be the first ones to see new, unreviewed content.

---

## 9. How You Can Help Keep ROOTED Safe

As a parent, guardian, or teacher, you can:

- Use Kids Mode together at first, so your child knows what it is.
- Report any content you think is unsafe or out-of-place for kids.
- Let us know if something feels confusing, misleading, or too adult.

ROOTED will:

- Provide clearly visible contact/support paths
- Take safety reports seriously
- Treat safety as governance-level work, not “support tickets”

---

## 10. If ROOTED Ever Changes

If ROOTED introduces new kids features, this Charter will be:

- Updated in GitHub
- Publicly versioned
- Reviewed against the Platform Constitution

No new kids feature is allowed to launch if it:

- Breaks this Charter
- Weakens child safety
- Introduces monetization into Kids Mode

---

## 11. Short Version for Parents

- Kids Mode is **view-only**, not a social network.
- No prices, bids, or donations are shown to kids.
- No messaging or comment wars in Kids Mode.
- Sanctuaries and nonprofits are presented as missions, not storefronts.
- Your child’s safety is more important than our revenue or growth.
- These rules are enforced in code and law, not just in marketing.

This is the standard ROOTED holds itself to for every child  
who ever touches the platform.
