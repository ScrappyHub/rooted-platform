# ROOTED – Public Trust & Community Pledge

Status: ✅ Canonical (Plain-Language Summary)  
Audience: Community members, vendors, institutions, parents, partners  
Authority Chain:
ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
→ ROOTED_GOVERNANCE_ETHICS.md  
→ This Pledge (simplified explanation)

This pledge explains, in human language, what ROOTED promises to protect  
and how the platform will behave as it grows.

If this pledge ever disagrees with the Constitution, the Constitution wins.

---

## 1. What ROOTED Is (In Plain Terms)

ROOTED is:

- A local directory of real community places
- A way for vendors and institutions to find each other fairly
- A map of farms, landmarks, events, and experiences
- A future home for education & kids-safe discovery
- A long-term infrastructure project for real communities, not a quick app

ROOTED is **not**:

- A place to spy on people
- A political advertising platform
- A system designed to trap attention or create addiction loops
- A “growth at all costs” company

---

## 2. Our Core Promises

### 2.1 Child Safety Comes First

- If child safety ever conflicts with money, growth, or convenience,
  ROOTED chooses child safety.
- Kids Mode will never show:
  - Pricing
  - Bidding tools
  - Donations or fundraising prompts
  - Direct messaging
  - Unmoderated community uploads
- Kids Mode is **OFF at Community launch**; when it goes live,
  these rules are already law.

### 2.2 Sanctuaries & Nonprofits Are Not Sales Channels

- Animal sanctuaries, rescues, and mission-first nonprofits:
  - Can appear in community discovery
  - Can run volunteer events and educational content
  - Cannot be turned into paid bidding or procurement engines
- We will not pressure sanctuaries into paid upgrades or commercial use.

### 2.3 Local First, Not “Winner Takes All”

- Discovery is capped to a **50-mile radius** by design.
- We show **small, curated sets** of local providers (6–8 cards),
  not endless, algorithmic feeds.
- This protects small local farms and businesses from being buried
  by large players.

### 2.4 No Hidden Power, No Silent Overrides

- No admin, developer, or founder can:
  - Quietly change your role or tier
  - Quietly override Kids Mode rules
  - Quietly grant commercial tools to restricted entities
- All powerful actions:
  - Are limited by law
  - Are enforced by the database
  - Are written to an admin audit log

### 2.5 No Exploiting Your Data

- ROOTED is not built to guess your identity, culture, or politics.
- We do not treat your data as a product to be sold.
- We do not build secret profiles to target or manipulate you.
- Sensitive inferences (religion, political views, etc.) are explicitly
  out of bounds by platform law.

---

## 3. How We Handle Money (Billing & Access)

- Vendors and institutions can pay for:
  - Bulk marketplace tools
  - Bidding tools (Premium Plus only)
  - Analytics
- Money **never** overrides:
  - Child safety
  - Sanctuary protections
  - GEO fairness (50-mile rule)
- Stripe handles payment details; ROOTED stores as little as possible.

If a billing idea conflicts with safety or fairness,  
we do not ship it.

---

## 4. What We Log and Why

We log:

- Admin actions that change roles, tiers, or features
- Moderation decisions
- Key system events tied to safety and governance

We log these to:

- Prove what happened
- Prevent silent abuse of power
- Audit and fix issues

We do **not** log for:

- Behavioral tracking “for fun”
- Secret targeting experiments
- Manipulative personalization

---

## 5. Community Expectations

We ask our community to:

- Treat ROOTED as shared infrastructure, not just content
- Use the platform in good faith
- Report safety issues, harassment, or misuse
- Respect sanctuaries, nonprofits, and kids-first spaces

We promise:

- Clear support channels
- Honest “what’s built vs not built” communication
- No dark patterns around canceling, deleting, or opting out

---

## 6. Changes to This Pledge

If ROOTED evolves, this pledge will be updated **in public**.

Any change must:

- Comply with the Platform Constitution
- Be reflected in the GitHub governance files
- Never weaken child safety, sanctuary protections, or core ethics

---

## 7. Short Version (Shareable)

- Kids come first. Always.
- Sanctuaries and nonprofits are protected, not monetized.
- Local communities are prioritized over big players.
- No hidden power, no silent overrides.
- No manipulative data practices.
- All meaningful changes are law-governed and auditable.

This is the trust we are building with you.
