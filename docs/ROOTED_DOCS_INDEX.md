# 🗂️ ROOTED — Docs Index (Canonical Router for /docs)

Location: `/docs/ROOTED_DOCS_INDEX.md`  
Authority Level: Canonical Documentation Router (Non-Law)  
Scope: This file indexes and routes all non-law documentation inside `/docs`.

> Governance law lives in `/governance`.  
> This index does NOT create law. It routes implementation, architecture, and operating docs.

## ✅ Required Additions (Docs-only, Non-Law)

### A) Optional Civic Sponsorship Slots (Docs-only)
Add a new file when ready:
- `ROOTED_CIVIC_SPONSORSHIP_SLOTS.md`  
  Defines optional ad/sponsorship placeholders:
  - Founder-controlled on/off
  - Never in Kids Mode or Teen Mode
  - Non-invasive (no behavioral profiling)
  - Only on permitted discovery surfaces

> This stays in /docs and must NOT be treated as governance law.

## 🧭 Doc Routing Rules

- If it defines power/access/safety/monetization authority → it belongs in `/governance`, not here.
- If it explains implementation, structure, debugging, readiness, or UI contracts → it belongs in `/docs`.
- If `/docs` conflicts with `/governance` → `/governance` wins.

## ✅ Index Status
This file is canonical for `/docs` navigation and must be kept updated when new docs are added.
