# ROOTED — PAYMENTS & PROCUREMENT MODEL (CANONICAL)

File: /docs/ROOTED_PAYMENTS_AND_PROCUREMENT_MODEL.md  
Authority Level: Implementation Contract (NON-LAW)  
Status: ✅ LOCKED | ✅ PRE-UI REQUIRED

---

## PURPOSE

Define how ROOTED supports procurement and payments without becoming the counterparty.

ROOTED is a governed connector + enforcement layer:
- role eligibility
- trust gating
- safe discovery
- procurement workflow
- minimal accounting for platform sustainability
- community impact metrics (non-extractive)

---

## PAYMENT PRINCIPLES

1) Payments are optional and never required for production readiness.
2) When implemented, ROOTED operates as a facilitator using Stripe (and/or partners) and does not assume delivery liability.
3) ROOTED stores the minimum possible payment metadata.
4) Payment activation is vertical-by-vertical and can remain PREPARED indefinitely.

---

## PROCUREMENT PRINCIPLES

- Procurement is proven first in:
  - Agriculture (institutions ↔ farms)
  - Construction (institutional projects)
- Community procurement markets are delayed and may never launch.
- Private-home procurement is explicitly not pursued.
