## 🛡️ ROOTED — FOUNDER PROTECTION & SUCCESSION LAW

Authority Level: Constitutional Extension  
Applies To: Founder, Admins, Developers, Contractors, Institutions, Vendors  
Enforcement Chain:  
GitHub Governance → Database Enforcement → Admin RPCs → UI  
Effective Date: First Public Deployment  

This document exists to ensure that ROOTED can never be captured, diluted, corrupted, or extracted from its founding intent — even if the Founder steps fully away from daily operations.

ROOTED is not an asset to be harvested.  
ROOTED is a protected civic system.

## 🧬 1. FOUNDER IDENTITY & ROLE (NON-CENTRALIZED BY DESIGN)

The Founder of ROOTED is legally and structurally defined as:

**Title:**

- Founder & Civic Systems Architect

**Permanent Functions:**

- Governance steward  
- Stop Layer authority  
- Architecture custodian  
- Youth safety defender  
- Vertical expansion gatekeeper  

**Explicitly NOT Required From the Founder:**

- Daily operations  
- Moderation  
- Content review  
- Vendor onboarding  
- Community management  
- Support operations  
- Revenue operations  

ROOTED must **never** be structurally dependent on the Founder’s daily presence to function.

This is a hard requirement of platform legitimacy.

---

## 🏛️ 2. OWNERSHIP & CONTROL DOCTRINE (SINGLE-MEMBER LLC ONLY)

ROOTED operates exclusively under:

- ✅ Single-Member LLC Ownership  
- ✅ 100% Equity Ownership — Founder Only  
- ✅ 100% Voting Power — Founder Only  
- ✅ No Silent Share Issuance  
- ✅ No Convertible Equity  
- ✅ No SAFE Notes  
- ✅ No Board Override Authority  

ROOTED may generate **revenue only** — never ownership dilution.

**❌ Prohibited Structures**

ROOTED may never:

- Become a multi-founder equity structure  
- Become VC-controlled  
- Become board-controlled  
- Become investor-governed  
- Become DAO-governed  

---

## ⚙️ 3. POWER DISTRIBUTION LAW (NO CAPTURE POSSIBLE)

ROOTED enforces the following non-centralized control model:

| System              | Who Controls It           |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Governance Law      | Founder only (via Git)    |
| Database RLS        | Immutable, policy-bound   |
| Admin Powers        | Logged & revocable        |
| Moderation          | Staff / moderators        |
| Content             | Community & institutions  |
| UI                  | Developers (within law)   |
| Revenue             | Providers & institutions  |
| Youth Protection    | Absolute law              |

No human — including the Founder — can bypass the law once deployed.

## 🧒 4. SUPREME CHILD SAFETY SUCCESSION CLAUSE

If the Founder becomes unavailable (temporary or permanent):

- ✅ Kids Mode remains active  
- ✅ Youth Protection Laws remain enforceable  
- ✅ No commercial access to children  
- ✅ No retroactive policy weakening  
- ✅ No monetization of youth surfaces  

No successor may override child safety. Ever.

---

## 🐾 5. SANCTUARY & NONPROFIT PROTECTION (NON-REVERSIBLE)

Even under full succession:

- Sanctuaries remain non-commercial forever  
- Volunteer-only law remains enforced  
- Marketplace access remains permanently blocked  
- Discovery remains protected from exploitation  

These protections survive any leadership change.

---

## 🧾 6. GIT IS LAW — EVEN AFTER THE FOUNDER

All legal authority remains bound to:

- GitHub governance files  
- SQL RLS policies  
- Admin RPCs  
- Constitutional & governance docs  

No successor may:

- Rewrite governance without public record  
- Remove the Stop Layer  
- Disable RLS  
- Add profiling fields  
- Add tracking SDKs  
- Add ad-tech  
- Add demographic targeting  

If it is **not written in GitHub**, it has **no standing authority**.

---

## 🔁 7. SUCCESSION TRIGGERS (WHEN THIS LAW ACTIVATES)

This law activates when any of the following occur:

- Founder goes inactive for 30+ days  
- Founder formally steps back  
- Founder becomes incapacitated  
- Founder appoints a Steward  
- Founder transfers operational control (not ownership)  

In all cases:

- ✅ Ownership remains with Founder or estate  
- ✅ Governance remains immutable  
- ✅ Revenue continues to fund operations  
- ✅ No extraction privileges emerge  

---

## 👤 8. SUCCESSION STEWARD ROLE (OPTIONAL BUT SAFE)

If appointed, a **Steward** may:

✅ Maintain infrastructure  
✅ Maintain governance enforcement  
✅ Oversee moderation teams  
✅ Oversee platform health  

A Steward may **never**:

❌ Change ownership  
❌ Alter the Stop Layer  
❌ Modify Youth Law  
❌ Enable profiling  
❌ Sell access  
❌ Monetize children  
❌ Override Sanctuary law  

All Steward actions remain:

- ✅ Logged

- ✅ Revocable  

---

## 🧮 9. REVENUE CONTINUITY (WITHOUT CONTROL LOSS)

ROOTED is permitted to generate revenue via:

- ✅ Vendor subscriptions  
- ✅ Institution access  
- ✅ Premium Plus features  
- ✅ Ethical ad placements (never in Kids Mode)  
- ✅ Experience facilitation  

ROOTED is **never** permitted to exchange:

- ❌ Control for revenue  
- ❌ Governance for growth  
- ❌ Safety for scalability  
- ❌ Trust for profit  

---

## 🧠 10. FOUNDER STEP-BACK — PRACTICAL IMPACT

Once ROOTED launches, the Founder’s role becomes:

- ✅ Platform Custodian  
- ✅ Governance Guardian

The Founder is **not required** to:

- ❌ Operate  
- ❌ Moderate  
- ❌ Sell

ROOTED runs without consuming the Founder’s life.
