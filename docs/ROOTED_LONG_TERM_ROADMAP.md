# ROOTED Long-Term Roadmap

ROOTED is designed as a multi-decade civic and community operating system.  
This roadmap is **directional**, not a promise or launch schedule.

Only **ROOTED Community** is in active development and production.  
Everything else is “future optional,” to be pursued only if it remains healthy for you and your region.

---

## 🟢 Phase 1 — Trust & Community (Active)

Focus:  
- Local food, culture, and community trust  
- Zero hype, slow growth, no pressure

Verticals:

- Community (directory, maps, events, landmarks)
- Agriculture & local food
- Gentle Kids education overlays (design-complete; pilot OFF at Community launch)

Goals:

- Prove the governance model
- Earn trust of families, schools, and local vendors
- Keep costs and complexity low

---

## 🟡 Phase 2 — Civic Infrastructure (Future Option)

Only pursued **if and when** Phase 1 is stable.

Possible verticals:

- Construction & built environment
- Manufacturing & supply chain
- Housing & community development
- Logistics & workforce coordination

Focus:

- Institutional procurement
- Real-world projects
- Zero interaction with kids surfaces

---

## 🔵 Phase 3 — Health & Emergency (Future Option)

Requires maximum trust, maturity, and compliance.

Possible verticals:

- Healthcare (non-clinical logistics & education only)
- Emergency response
- Disaster recovery
- Mental wellness (education-only)

Focus:

- Community health programs
- Preparedness & resilience
- Strict non-clinical, no-medical-data boundaries

---

## 🟣 Phase 4 — Regional Operating System (Future Option)

Long-range possibility, **not a goal you owe anyone**.

Potential scope:

- Municipal and regional services
- Utilities and transit coordination
- Research & planning overlays
- Civic dashboards for real-world infrastructure

---

## ✋ No-Hype Principle

- No phase is guaranteed.  
- No vertical is promised to partners or the public.  
- You are allowed to pause or stop at any time.  
- ROOTED Community can exist as a beautiful, self-contained chapter of your life.

ROOTED grows only when:

- Governance is ready  
- Your life capacity allows it  
- Your region genuinely needs it  

If those conditions are not met, **staying small is success.**
