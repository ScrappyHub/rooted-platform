# ROOTED — VERTICAL REGISTRY (CANONICAL v2)

Authority Level: Operational Registry (Non-Binding)  
Governance Chain:
ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION  
→ ROOTED_STOP_LAYER  
→ ROOTED_GOVERNANCE_INDEX  
→ ROOTED_FOUNDER_PROTECTION_AND_SUCCESSION  
→ ROOTED_LONG_TERM_ROADMAP  
→ This Registry  

This file tracks which ROOTED verticals are:

- ✅ Live (Public & Active)
- 🚧 In Development (Backend / Design Work Only)
- 🧩 Placeholder (Future-Phase, Documentation Only)

This registry is **descriptive, not a promise**.  
No vertical may advance status without passing:

- Governance law
- Abuse testing
- Founder capacity review

---

## ✅ LIVE (PUBLIC & PRODUCTION)

These are the only systems currently considered **public-facing and production-intent**:

- `rooted-community`

Scope:
- Community directory
- Maps & landmarks
- Events & volunteering
- Discovery & seasonal overlays
- Farm & local food ecosystem

Cross-References:

- `ROOTED_KIDS_MODE_GOVERNANCE.md`
- `ROOTED_SECURITY.md`
- `ROOTED_LONG_TERM_ROADMAP.md` (Phase 1)

## 🚧 IN DEVELOPMENT (BACKEND / DESIGN STAGE ONLY)

These repos contain schemas, audits, and hardening documentation.
They are **NOT live apps** and **NOT visible to the public**.

- `rooted-construction`
- `rooted-healthcare` (non-clinical placeholders only)

Rules:
- No UI is considered production-ready
- No public users may access these systems
- No monetization or transaction flows are considered live

## 🧩 FUTURE PHASE (PLACEHOLDER / DOCUMENTATION ONLY)

These repos exist for:

- Planning
- Documentation
- Taxonomy alignment
- Governance stress-testing
- Roadmap staging

They are **NOT production systems** and may never become live.

## 🚫 STATUS CHANGE RESTRICTIONS

A vertical may NOT move from:

🧩 → 🚧  
or  
🚧 → ✅  

unless ALL of the following are true:

- Governance laws are written and approved
- Abuse Test Matrix passes with ✅
- Security review is complete
- Founder explicitly opts in
- Life capacity & regional need both justify it

If any pressure attempts to force a vertical live:

→ The Stop Layer nullifies that attempt.
