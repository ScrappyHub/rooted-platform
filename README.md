# ROOTED Platform — Master Control Repository

ROOTED is a governed, vertically expandable civic, economic, and educational operating system.

This repository acts as the **single source of truth** for:
- Platform architecture
- Governance rules
- Core shared systems
- Vertical expansion strategy
- Long-term roadmap

No production application code lives here.
This is the **platform brain**.

---

## 🔒 Governance First

ROOTED is built on:
- Safety-first design
- Consent-based systems
- Role + tier enforcement
- Kids Mode protection
- Cultural & seasonal intelligence

These rules apply to ALL verticals.

---

## 🧱 Core Systems (Shared Across All Verticals)

All verticals inherit:

- Auth + Identity
- Roles & Tiers
- Feature Flags
- Providers (vendors + institutions)
- Media (public + protected)
- Procurement (RFQs, Bids, Bulk)
- Messaging
- Events & Experiences
- Landmarks & Maps
- Analytics
- Kids Mode
- Cultural & Holiday Consent

No vertical is allowed to bypass these.
