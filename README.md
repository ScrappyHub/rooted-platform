# ROOTED PLATFORM — MASTER CONTROL REPOSITORY (CANONICAL)

ROOTED is a governed, vertically expandable **civic, economic, and educational operating system**.

This repository is the **single source of truth** for:

- Platform architecture
- Governance law
- Core shared systems
- Vertical expansion rules
- Long-term roadmap
- Founder protection & succession design

❌ No production application code lives here  
✅ This repository is the **platform brain**

---

## 🔒 SUPREME AUTHORITY

- `ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`  
  → **Highest authority**  
  → Includes the **Constitutional Stop Layer**  
  → References all binding platform laws  

If anything in any repo contradicts the Constitution →  
**The Constitution ALWAYS wins.**

- `ROOTED_STOP_LAYER.md`

## 🛡️ GOVERNANCE FIRST (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

ROOTED is permanently built on:

- Safety-first design
- Consent-based systems
- Role + tier enforcement
- Kids Mode protection
- Sanctuary & nonprofit immunities
- Cultural & seasonal intelligence

These rules apply to:

✅ Core  
✅ Community  
✅ All current & future verticals  
✅ All UI  
✅ All AI contributors  

There are **no exemptions**.

## 🧱 CORE SYSTEMS (INHERITED BY ALL VERTICALS)

All verticals inherit these systems without modification:

- Auth + Identity
- Roles & Tiers
- Feature Flags
- Account Status
- Providers (vendors + institutions)
- Media (public + protected)
- Procurement (RFQs, Bids, Bulk)
- Messaging
- Events & Experiences
- Landmarks & Maps
- Analytics
- Notifications
- Kids Mode
- Cultural & Holiday Consent
- Moderation
- Badges & Compliance

❌ No vertical may bypass these  
❌ No UI may replace these  
✅ Enforcement lives at the **database + RLS layer**

- `ROOTED_ACCESS_POWER_LAW.md`

## 🧑‍⚖️ FOUNDER & SUCCESSION SAFETY

This repository exists so that:

- ROOTED does not rely on one human to survive
- Founder retains protection without becoming a dictator
- Succession is technically survivable
- Power cannot silently concentrate

## ✅ FINAL STATEMENT

This repository defines the **operating system behind ROOTED**.

If ROOTED ever violates these rules →  
It is no longer ROOTED.
