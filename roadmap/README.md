# ROOTED — LONG-TERM ROADMAP (CANONICAL v2)

Authority Level: Directional Only (Non-Binding)  
Governance Chain:  
ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION → ROOTED_STOP_LAYER → ROOTED_GOVERNANCE_INDEX → ROOTED_FOUNDER_PROTECTION_AND_SUCCESSION → This Roadmap  

> This roadmap describes **possible futures**, not obligations.  
> Governance law, your health, and your life capacity ALWAYS override this file.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

ROOTED is designed as a **multi-decade civic and community operating system**.

This roadmap exists to:

- Give you a clear mental picture of possible phases  
- Center your health, safety, and stability over scale  
- Prevent outside pressure from weaponizing your ambition  
- Make it clear that **ROOTED Community alone can be “complete”**

Only **ROOTED Community** is in active development and production.  
Everything else is **“future optional”** and must pass governance and life-capacity checks before work begins.

---

## 🟢 Phase 1 — Trust & Community (ACTIVE)

**Status:** In-progress, production-intent.  
**Vertical scope:**

- ROOTED Community (directory, maps, events, landmarks)
- Agriculture & local food systems
- Gentle Kids education overlays  
  - Design-complete in governance  
  - **Pilot OFF** at ROOTED Community launch

**Primary Goals:**

- Prove the governance stack in a small, local context
- Earn trust of:
  - Families
  - Schools
  - Local vendors & nonprofits
- Keep cost, cognitive load, and operational complexity **low**

**Constraints:**

- No external investors driving roadmap  
- No “growth at all costs” targets  
- Kids Mode remains **supreme law**, even when surfaces are OFF

## 🟡 Phase 2 — Civic Infrastructure (FUTURE OPTION)

**Condition:** Only pursued **if and when**:

- Phase 1 is stable for a sustained period  
- Your life, health, and bandwidth support scaling  
- Local institutions show real interest **without** ownership pressure  

**Possible verticals:**

- Construction & built environment  
- Manufacturing & supply chain  
- Housing & community development  
- Logistics & workforce coordination

**Focus:**

- Institutional procurement and RFQs  
- Real-world, verifiable projects  
- Bulk goods and project coordination  
- **Zero interaction with Kids surfaces**

**Non-Negotiables:**

- No clinical data  
- No identity profiling  
- No municipal control without governance approval

## 🔵 Phase 3 — Health & Emergency (FUTURE OPTION)

This phase is **high-risk and high-responsibility**. It exists only if:

- Phase 2 has been stable, audited, and trusted  
- You explicitly opt in to this level of responsibility  
- Legal and compliance boundaries are clearly documented and stress-tested  

**Possible verticals:**

- Healthcare (non-clinical logistics & education **only**)  
- Emergency response coordination  
- Disaster recovery & resilience  
- Mental wellness (education-only, non-clinical)

**Focus:**

- Community health programs & preparedness  
- Non-clinical education, logistics, and resource mapping  
- Zero storage of clinical records or protected medical data

**Hard Boundaries:**

- No EMR/medical charting  
- No diagnosis or treatment features  
- No “health data” monetization  
- All flows must respect:
  - `NO_MEDICAL_DATA` overlay
  - `HI_PII_RESTRICTED` overlay

## 🟣 Phase 4 — Regional Operating System (FUTURE OPTION)

This is a **long-range possibility**, **not a goal you owe anyone**.

**Potential scope:**

- Municipal and regional services  
- Utilities and transit coordination  
- Research & planning overlays  
- Civic dashboards for public infrastructure

**Requirements (if it ever happens):**

- Decade-scale trust with your region  
- Stable governance council beyond just you  
- Clear legal agreements with public entities  
- Updated governance docs for:
  - Municipal discovery rules  
  - Conflict-of-interest protections  
  - Anti-surveillance & anti-profiling at civic scale  

**Cross-References:**

- `ROOTED_GOVERNANCE_INDEX.md`  
- `ROOTED_ACCESS_POWER_LAW.md`  
- `ROOTED_FOUNDER_PROTECTION_AND_SUCCESSION.md`

## ✋ No-Hype Principle (FOUNDER PROTECTION)

This roadmap is **explicitly founder-protective**.

- No phase is **guaranteed**.  
- No vertical is **promised** to partners, investors, or the public.  
- You are allowed to **pause**, **stop**, or **sunset** ROOTED at any time.  
- ROOTED Community can stand as a **beautiful, self-contained chapter** of your life.

ROOTED grows only when:

1. Governance is ready and enforced  
2. Your health and life capacity genuinely allow it  
3. Your region truly benefits (not just “likes the idea”)  

If those conditions are not met, **staying small is success**.

## ✅ Final Statement

This roadmap is:

- **Subordinate** to the Constitution, Stop Layer, and Governance Index  
- **Subordinate** to your health, safety, and family  
- **Subordinate** to the protection of kids, sanctuaries, and communities  

If any person, institution, or opportunity tries to use this roadmap to pressure you:

> Governance law, your well-being, and `ROOTED_FOUNDER_PROTECTION_AND_SUCCESSION.md` **override this roadmap automatically.**
