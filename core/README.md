# ROOTED Core Systems

This folder defines what ALL verticals inherit without modification.

## ✅ Core Modules

## 🔑 Core Principle

If a feature exists in **any vertical**, its security must exist in CORE first.

No exceptions.

## 🛑 Non-Negotiables

- Core rules override vertical behavior
- Core governance cannot be bypassed by UI
- Core enforcement happens at the database layer
