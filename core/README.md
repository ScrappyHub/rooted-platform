# ROOTED — CORE SYSTEMS (CANONICAL)

Path: rooted-platform/core/README.md  
Authority Level: Core Inheritance Law  
Enforcement Chain:
ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION  
→ ROOTED_STOP_LAYER  
→ ROOTED_GOVERNANCE_INDEX  
→ ROOTED_CORE (THIS FOLDER)  
→ Vertical Implementations  
→ UI  

This folder defines what **ALL verticals inherit without modification**.

No vertical is allowed to override, weaken, or replace anything defined here.

---

## ✅ CORE MODULES (STRUCTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE)

These modules exist **once** and are inherited universally:

- Identity
- Authentication & Sessions
- User Tiers
- Feature Flags
- Account Status
- Providers
- Media & Storage
- Procurement (RFQs, Bids, Bulk)
- Messaging
- Events
- Landmarks
- Feed
- Analytics
- Notifications
- Kids Mode
- Cultural & Holiday Logic
- Moderation
- Compliance & Badges
- Discovery & GEO Rules

---

## 🔑 CORE PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

If a feature exists in **any vertical**, its:

- Security  
- RLS  
- Compliance  
- Kids Safety  
- Abuse Resistance  
- Auditability  

**MUST EXIST IN CORE FIRST.**

No exceptions.  
No vertical is allowed to ship its own security model.

## ✅ ALLOWED WORK FROM THIS POINT FORWARD

✅ UI wiring  
✅ Component design  
✅ Mobile layouts  
✅ Animations  
✅ UX polish  
✅ Accessibility improvements  
✅ Performance optimization  
✅ Feedback-driven refinements  
✅ Styling refactors  

---

## ❌ FORBIDDEN WORK (UNLESS A CRITICAL SECURITY BUG EXISTS)

❌ Schema rewrites  
❌ RLS loosening  
❌ Governance changes  
❌ New market class creation  
❌ Kids rule changes  
❌ Admin power expansion  
❌ Data ownership changes  
❌ Vertical-level security overrides  

These are classified as **Governance-Breaking Changes** and trigger:

- Immediate Stop Layer review  
- Merge rejection  
- Governance audit  

---

## 🛑 NON-NEGOTIABLE ENFORCEMENT RULES

- Core rules override all vertical behavior
- Core governance **cannot be bypassed** by UI
- Core enforcement happens **at the database + RLS layer only**
- Frontend has **zero authority**
- No monetization exists outside core law
- Kids Mode always supersedes UI logic

---

✅ FINAL STATEMENT

CORE is the **constitutional engine** of ROOTED.

Every vertical is a **guest** in this system.

If a vertical cannot obey CORE, it **cannot exist**.
