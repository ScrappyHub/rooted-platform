# ROOTED — PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE (CANONICAL)

Path: architecture/README.md  
Authority Level: Platform Structural Law  
Enforcement Chain:
ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION  
→ ROOTED_STOP_LAYER  
→ ROOTED_GOVERNANCE_INDEX  
→ ROOTED_CORE  
→ Architecture (THIS FILE)  
→ Verticals  
→ UI  

ROOTED is NOT a single application.  
It is a **multi-vertical, law-governed civic platform**.

## 🧬 VERTICAL PLUG-IN MODEL (STRICT)

Each vertical:

✅ Reuses the SAME core  
✅ Inherits ALL governance  
✅ Adds ONLY:

- Categories
- Compliance overlays
- Education content
- Experience types

❌ No vertical may define:

- Its own auth
- Its own tiers
- Its own Kids rules
- Its own monetization logic
- Its own discovery weighting
- Its own admin authority

- ROOTED_VERTICAL_REGISTRY.md  
- ROOTED_LONG_TERM_ROADMAP.md

## 🧑‍⚖️ FOUNDER & SUCCESSION SAFETY

Architecture is explicitly designed so that:

- No vertical depends on founder presence
- No vertical requires central personality
- No admin gains silent authority
- Succession is technically survivable

## ✅ FINAL STATEMENT

ROOTED behaves like:

- A civic operating system  
- A governed infrastructure platform  
- A safety-first community engine  

ROOTED is **NOT**:

- A startup app
- A social network
- A monetization engine
- A growth-at-all-costs system

Architecture exists to **protect humans first**, markets second, and scale last.
