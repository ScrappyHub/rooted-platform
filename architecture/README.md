# ROOTED Platform Architecture

ROOTED is not a single app.
It is a **multi-vertical governed platform**.

## 🧬 Vertical Plug-in Model

Each vertical:
- Reuses the SAME core
- Adds only:
  - Categories
  - Compliance overlays
  - Education content
  - Experience types

No vertical gets custom governance.

ROOTED behaves like Salesforce + Stripe + Civic OS merged into one.
