## 🧭 ROOTED IS A GOVERNANCE-FIRST PLATFORM

ROOTED is a civic, community, and institutional operating system.

It is governed by:

- Consent over extraction  
- Safety over monetization  
- Community over surveillance  
- Child protection over growth  
- Institutional trust over speed  

These rules are **not optional** for any contributor.

## 🔒 CHILD SAFETY IS SUPREME

All contributors must treat **child safety as an absolute priority**.

You may **never**:

- Monetize Kids Mode in any way  
- Expose pricing, fundraising, subscriptions, RFQs, or bids to minors  
- Allow vendors or institutions to directly message children  
- Introduce analytics, ads, or tracking into Kids Mode  
- Circumvent kids-safe content filters in UI or backend  

Violation of child safety rules results in:

- Immediate removal from ROOTED systems  
- Permanent contributor ban  
- Possible legal escalation

## 🎭 CULTURAL & HOLIDAY CONSENT IS MANDATORY

Contributors may **never**:

- Auto-enable holidays or cultural sets  
- Infer religion, ethnicity, or culture from behavior  
- Apply holiday themes without explicit user AND business opt-in  
- Override Kids Mode holiday restrictions  

Cultural consent is a **human right**, not a feature toggle.

## 🧠 DATA BELONGS TO USERS — NOT CONTRIBUTORS

You may **never**:

- Add silent data collection  
- Add hidden tracking or fingerprinting  
- Add third-party data resale paths  
- Create behavioral profiling pipelines  
- Share user data outside governed ROOTED systems  

All data systems must honor:

- Access

- Use admin access without logging  
- Grant commercial access to prohibited entities (sanctuaries, kids, etc.)  
- Force discovery placement for profit or favoritism  
- Bypass feature flags or RLS  
- Override moderation outcomes silently  

All power inside ROOTED is **narrow, logged, and auditable**.
