## 🧭 ROOTED IS A GOVERNANCE-FIRST PLATFORM

ROOTED is a civic, community, and institutional operating system.

It is governed by:

- Consent over extraction  
- Safety over monetization  
- Community over surveillance  
- Child protection over growth  
- Institutional trust over speed  

These rules are **not optional**.

---

## 🔒 CHILD SAFETY IS SUPREME

All contributors must treat **child safety as an absolute priority**.

You may **never**:

- Monetize Kids Mode
- Expose pricing, fundraising, subscriptions, RFQs, or bids to minors
- Allow vendors or institutions to message children
- Introduce analytics, ads, or tracking into Kids Mode
- Circumvent kids-safe content filters

Violation of child safety rules results in:

- Immediate removal from ROOTED systems
- Permanent contributor ban
- Potential legal escalation

---

## 🎭 CULTURAL & HOLIDAY CONSENT IS MANDATORY

You may **never**:

- Auto-enable holidays
- Infer religion, ethnicity, or culture
- Apply holiday themes without user and business opt-in
- Override Kids Mode holiday restrictions

Cultural consent is a **human right**, not a feature toggle.

## 🧠 DATA BELONGS TO USERS — NOT CONTRIBUTORS

You may **never**:

- Add silent data collection
- Add hidden tracking
- Add third-party data resale
- Create behavioral profiling pipelines
- Share user data outside ROOTED systems

All data systems must honor:

- Access
- Export
- Correction
- Deletion

You may **never**:

- Use admin access without logging
- Grant commercial access to prohibited entities (sanctuaries, kids, etc.)
- Force discovery placement for profit
- Bypass feature flags
- Override moderation outcomes silently

All power inside ROOTED is **auditable**.

## 🛡️ TRUST IS A PRECONDITION FOR VISIBILITY

You may **never**:

- Surface unmoderated content publicly
- Publish draft or rejected content
- Create shadow publishing systems
- Bypass discovery safety views

---

## ⚖️ ZERO EXCEPTIONS CLAUSE

No contributor may claim:

- Time pressure  
- Investor demand  
- Client pressure
