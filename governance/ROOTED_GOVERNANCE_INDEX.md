🧬 ROOTED — GOVERNANCE INDEX & CHAIN OF AUTHORITY (v3 • CANONICAL)
🧭 PURPOSE

This file is the single entry point for all governance inside ROOTED.

It defines:

What laws exist

What order they apply in

How conflicts are resolved

What systems enforce them

What documents hold legal authority

👉 If anything contradicts this index → this index wins.

🛑 ZERO-OVERRIDE STOP LAYER (SUPREME LOCK)

Authority Level: ABSOLUTE
Enforcement: GitHub → Database → Admin RPCs → UI
Effective Date: First Public Launch

If ANY of the following ever conflict with this Stop Layer:

Features

Monetization

Contracts

UI behavior

Admin actions

Partner requests

Investor pressure

👉 THIS STOP LAYER WINS. NO EXCEPTIONS.

✅ PERMANENTLY LOCKED PLATFORM LAWS (ONLY LEGAL AUTHORITY)

These files function as non-overrideable platform law:

ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md

ROOTED_DATA_SOVEREIGNTY_LAW.md

ROOTED_ACCESS_POWER_LAW.md

ROOTED_COMMUNITY_TRUST_LAW.md

ROOTED_SANCTUARY_NONPROFIT_LAW.md

ROOTED_CONTRIBUTOR_GOVERNANCE_NOTICE.md

ROOTED_KIDS_MODE_GOVERNANCE.md

ROOTED_ADMIN_GOVERNANCE.md

ROOTED_PRE_COMMIT_GOVERNANCE_CHECKLIST.md

If it is not expressed in one of these files → it has NO authority inside ROOTED.
