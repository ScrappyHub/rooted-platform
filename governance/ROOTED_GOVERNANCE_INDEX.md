🧭 PURPOSE

This file is the single entry point for all governance inside ROOTED.

It defines:

What laws exist

What order they apply in

How conflicts are resolved

What systems enforce them

What documents hold legal authority

If anything contradicts this index → this index wins.

🏛️ GOVERNANCE HIERARCHY (CHAIN OF AUTHORITY)

ROOTED is governed in strict descending order of authority:

✅ ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md
→ Defines identity, ethics, power limits, child safety supremacy

✅ Governance Law Files (Listed Below)
→ Enforceable operational laws

✅ Database Enforcement

Row Level Security (RLS)

Canonical Views

Feature Flags

Admin RPCs

✅ Admin Oversight

Moderation

Account actions

Badge assignment

Feature flag management

✅ User Interface

Display layer only

Never an authority layer

If any layer conflicts with a higher layer → the higher layer overrides immediately.
