## 1. 🎯 Purpose of This File

This file is the **system-wide governor** that binds:

- Identity
- Roles & tiers
- Feature flags
- Vertical interoperation
- Kids Mode & Sanctuary behavior across ROOTED

This file **DOES NOT**:

- Define database schema  
- Define UI design  
- Override the Stop Layer or Constitution  

---

## 2. 🆔 Single Identity Doctrine (Hard Law)

- Every human has **ONE ROOTED identity**
- One `auth.users` row  
- One `public.user_tiers` row  
- Multiple verticals may attach to this same identity  

🚫 No second account  
🚫 No shadow login  
🚫 No duplicate identity per vertical  

All verticals **MUST** reuse:

- `user_tiers.role`
- `user_tiers.tier`
- `user_tiers.feature_flags`

---

## 3. ⚖️ Roles, Tiers & Power (Cross-Law Binding Summary)

### Roles
- `community_member`
- `vendor`
- `institution`
- `admin`

### Tiers
- `free`
- `premium`
- `premium_plus`

### 🔒 Non-Negotiable Rule

No tier upgrade may bypass:

- Kids Mode Law
- Sanctuary Law
- Admin Governance Law
- Data Sovereignty Law  

**More power never overrides safety.**

---

## 4. 🧭 ROOTED Vertical Model (Law-Bound)

ROOTED operates five verticals:

1. **Community** — civic discovery, food, land, trust  
2. **Education** — institutions, learning, field trips, sessions  
3. **Construction** — B2B infrastructure & services  
4. **Experiences** — guided activities, outdoor & adventure  
5. **Arts & Culture** — venues, galleries, shows, cultural life  

Each vertical:

- Must define its scope in its own Vertical Governance file  
- May **NOT** override:
  - Kids Mode
  - Sanctuary Protection
  - Access & Power Law
  - Data Law  
- Must use the **same identity + tier system**

---

## 5. 🧒 Kids Mode & 🐾 Sanctuary Binding Across All Verticals

### 🧒 Kids Mode

Defined **ONLY** in:

- `/governance/ROOTED_KIDS_MODE_GOVERNANCE.md`

All verticals must enforce:

- Non-commercial
- No messaging
- No donations
- No analytics
- No pressure mechanics  

Vertical docs may describe *where* Kids content appears,  
but **may never weaken protection.**

---

### 🐾 Sanctuaries & Rescues

Governed **ONLY** by:

- `/governance/ROOTED_SANCTUARY_NONPROFIT_LAW.md`

Sanctuaries must **NEVER**:

- Monetize
- Bid
- Use RFQs
- Enter bulk markets  

They may **ONLY**:

- Host volunteer work
- Host education  

Only **Community** (and explicitly authorized verticals) may surface sanctuaries.

---

## 6. 🔑 Vertical Access & Invitations

All vertical access rules live in:

- `/governance/ROOTED_VERTICAL_ACCESS_CONTRACT.md`

This file enforces **cross-vertical integrity**.  
Vertical docs **may NOT redefine identity or access mechanics.**

---

## 7. 🖥️ Frontend & Figma Are Bound — But Not Law

Frontend, Vercel, Figma, and UI flows:

- ✅ May only **IMPLEMENT** law  
- ❌ May **NOT DEFINE** law  

Contracts live in:

- `/docs/ROOTED_FRONTEND_SYSTEM_CONTRACT.md`

---

## 8. 🛑 Change Control (Hard Lock)

Any change that impacts:

- Roles
- Tiers
- Kids Mode
- Sanctuaries
- Vertical access
- Identity

**MUST:**

1. Update this file  
2. Update Vertical Governance  
3. Pass:
   - Stop Layer
   - Enforcement Matrix
   - Pre-Commit Checklist

## ✅ STATUS

**CORE SYSTEM GOVERNANCE IS NOW CANONICALLY LOCKED**  
All work beyond this point is **execution only**.
