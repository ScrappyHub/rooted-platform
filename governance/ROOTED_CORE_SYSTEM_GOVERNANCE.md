1. Purpose of This File

This file is the system-wide governor that binds:

Identity

Roles & tiers

Feature flags

Vertical interoperation

Kids Mode & Sanctuary behavior across ROOTED

This file DOES NOT:

Define database schema

Define UI design

Override the Stop Layer or Constitution

2. Single Identity Doctrine (Hard Law)

Every human has ONE ROOTED identity

One auth.users row

One public.user_tiers row

Multiple verticals may attach to this same identity

🚫 No second account
🚫 No shadow login
🚫 No duplicate identity per vertical

All verticals must reuse:

user_tiers.role

user_tiers.tier

user_tiers.feature_flags

3. Roles, Tiers, & Power (Cross-Law Binding Summary)

Roles

community_member

vendor

institution

admin

Tiers

free

premium

premium_plus

Non-Negotiable Rule

No tier upgrade may bypass:

Kids Mode Law

Sanctuary Law

Admin Governance Law

Data Sovereignty Law

More power never overrides safety.

4. ROOTED Vertical Model (Law-Bound)

ROOTED operates five verticals:

Community — civic discovery, food, land, trust

Education — institutions, learning, field trips, sessions

Construction — B2B infrastructure & services

Experiences — guided activities, outdoor & adventure

Arts & Culture — venues, galleries, shows, cultural life

Each vertical:

Must define its scope in its own vertical governance

May NOT override:

Kids Mode

Sanctuary protection

Access & Power law

Data law

Must use the same identity + tier system

5. Kids Mode & Sanctuary Binding Across All Verticals
Kids Mode

Defined ONLY in /governance/ROOTED_KIDS_MODE_GOVERNANCE.md

All verticals must enforce:

Non-commercial

No messaging

No donations

No analytics

No pressure mechanics

Vertical docs may describe where Kids content appears, but never weaken protection.

Sanctuaries & Rescues

Governed ONLY by /governance/ROOTED_SANCTUARY_NONPROFIT_LAW.md

Must NEVER:

Monetize

Bid

Use RFQs

Enter bulk markets

May ONLY:

Host volunteer

Host education

Only Community (and explicitly authorized verticals) may surface sanctuaries.

6. Vertical Access & Invitations

All vertical access rules live in:

/governance/ROOTED_VERTICAL_ACCESS_CONTRACT.md

This file enforces cross-vertical integrity.
Vertical docs may NOT redefine identity or access mechanics.

7. Frontend & Figma Are Bound but Not Law

Frontend, Vercel, Figma, UI flows:

May only IMPLEMENT law

May NOT DEFINE law

Contracts live in:

/docs/ROOTED_FRONTEND_SYSTEM_CONTRACT.md

8. Change Control (Hard Lock)

Any change that impacts:

Roles

Tiers

Kids Mode

Sanctuaries

Vertical access

Identity

MUST:

Update this file

Update Vertical Governance

Pass:

Stop Layer

Enforcement Matrix

Pre-Commit Checklist

✅ STATUS: CORE SYSTEM GOVERNANCE IS NOW CANONICALLY LOCKED
