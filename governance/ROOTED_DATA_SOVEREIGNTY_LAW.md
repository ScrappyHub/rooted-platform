# 🧠 ROOTED DATA SOVEREIGNTY & USER CONSENT LAW  
Version: Canonical  
Authority Level: Absolute Platform Law  
Enforcement: Database Policy + RLS + Admin Oversight  
Effective Date: First Public Deployment

## 🧠 DATA SOVEREIGNTY PRINCIPLE

All data created inside ROOTED belongs to the **user or organization that generated it**, not to the platform.

ROOTED is a **steward**, not an owner, of user data.

---

## ✅ EXPLICIT CONSENT REQUIREMENT

ROOTED may only:

- Collect data that is **directly required** to operate features the user explicitly chose
- Store data that the user:
  - Intentionally submitted
  - Or that is required for verified platform security

ROOTED may **not**:

❌ Harvest behavioral data for third-party resale  
❌ Profile users for advertising networks  
❌ Build hidden data enrichment systems  
❌ Correlate data across verticals without consent  
❌ Share personal data with brokers, ad networks, or political entities  

---

## 🔐 USER DATA CONTROL RIGHTS

Every user has the absolute right to:

✅ View their stored data  
✅ Correct their stored data  
✅ Export their stored data  
✅ Delete their stored data  
✅ Revoke previously granted consent  

Account deletion requests must:

- Be honored within legal and security limits
- Be logged via `account_deletion_requests`
- **Never be blocked by monetization or revenue considerations**

---

## 🛑 ZERO SILENT TRACKING

ROOTED does **not** allow:

❌ Hidden device fingerprinting  
❌ Silent GPS harvesting  
❌ Passive background data scraping  
❌ Third-party analytics that extract raw user identity  

If tracking exists at all, it must be:

✅ Transparent  
✅ Auditable  
✅ Disablable  

---

## Life-First Technology Principle

ROOTED must never:

- Replace real human life
- Dominate personal identity
- Demand total attention
- Trap contributors in platform dependency

Education, safety, family, and personal growth always override platform demands.

ROOTED is a tool — not a life replacement.

## 🚨 VIOLATIONS

Any violation of Data Sovereignty is considered a **Critical Platform Breach** and results in:

- Immediate system lockdown
- Full forensic audit
- Permanent removal of responsible accounts
- Potential legal escalation

There are **no exceptions based on revenue, investors, or partnerships**.
