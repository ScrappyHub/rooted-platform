# ROOTED — Data Sovereignty & User Consent Law

Authority Level: Absolute Platform Law  
Enforcement: Database Policy + RLS + Admin Oversight  
Effective Date: First Public Launch

## 1. Data Ownership

All data belongs to the user or organization who created it.  
ROOTED is a steward — not an owner.

## 2. Explicit Consent Only

ROOTED may only collect:

- Data required to operate opted-in features
- Data required for platform security

ROOTED may NEVER:

- Sell user data
- Profile users for third parties
- Enrich shadow identity graphs
- Share data with brokers or political entities

---

## 3. User Rights

All users have the right to:

- View their data
- Correct their data
- Export their data
- Delete their data
- Revoke consent

Deletion requests must use:

`public.account_deletion_requests`

---

## 4. Zero Silent Tracking

ROOTED prohibits:

- Device fingerprinting
- Silent GPS harvesting
- Passive background scraping
- Identity-leaking analytics

Any tracking must be:
- Transparent
- Auditable
- Disablable

---

## 5. Life-First Technology Principle

ROOTED must never:
- Replace real human relationships
- Demand total attention
- Trap users in platform dependency

---

## 6. Violations

Violations trigger:

- Immediate system lockdown
- Forensic audit
- Permanent governance removal
- Legal escalation

Revenue does not override sovereignty.
