🧠 DATA SOVEREIGNTY PRINCIPLE

All data created inside ROOTED belongs to the user or organization that generated it, not to the platform.

ROOTED is a steward, not an owner, of user data.

✅ EXPLICIT CONSENT REQUIREMENT

ROOTED may only:

Collect data that is directly required to operate features the user explicitly chose

Store data that the user:

Intentionally submitted

Or is required for verified platform security

ROOTED may not:

❌ Harvest behavioral data for third-party resale

❌ Profile users for advertising networks

❌ Build hidden data enrichment systems

❌ Correlate data across verticals without consent

❌ Share personal data with brokers, ad networks, or political entities

🔐 USER DATA CONTROL RIGHTS

Every user has the right to:

View their stored data

Correct their stored data

Export their stored data

Delete their stored data

Revoke previously granted consent

Account deletion requests must:

Be honored within the platform’s legal and security limits

Be logged via account_deletion_requests

Never be blocked by monetization or revenue considerations

🛑 ZERO SILENT TRACKING

ROOTED does not allow:

Hidden device fingerprinting

Silent GPS harvesting

Passive background data scraping

Third-party analytics that extract raw user identity

If tracking exists at all, it must be:

Transparent

Auditable

Disablable

🚨 VIOLATIONS

Any violation of Data Sovereignty is considered a Critical Platform Breach and results in:

Immediate system lockdown

Full audit

Permanent removal of responsible accounts

Potential legal escalation
