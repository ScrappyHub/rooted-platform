# 🌱 ROOTED VOLUNTEER PARTICIPATION LAW

Authority Level: Canonical Vertical Law (Community & Future Verticals)  
Enforcement: Constitution → Governance → Database (RLS + Views) → UI  
Effective Date: First Public Launch  

Volunteer systems in ROOTED are **civic participation**, not labor markets.

---

## 1. Who Can Host Volunteer Opportunities?

Volunteer opportunities are **events**, not jobs, gigs, or paid shifts.

Allowed volunteer hosts in the Community vertical:

✅ Vendors (in good standing):  
- Farms  
- Markets and orchards  
- Food vendors and community staples  
- Other approved community businesses  

✅ Sanctuaries / rescues / mission-driven nonprofits:  
- Farm animal sanctuaries  
- Wildlife rehabilitation centers  
- Equine rescues  
- Conservation / environmental orgs, etc.  

✅ Institutions:  
- Schools and universities  
- Libraries  
- Community centers  
- Nonprofits  
- Municipal or civic entities configured for Community  

**Not allowed to host volunteers in Community:**

❌ Purely backend / infrastructure-only institutions  
❌ Any provider not in good standing (suspended / locked)  
❌ Any provider attempting to combine “volunteer” with hidden paid work  

> Volunteer = community contribution,  
> **not** stealth labor or misclassified employment.

## 2. Who Can Join Volunteer Opportunities?

Volunteer participation is aligned with ROOTED’s age and account laws.

### 2.1 Children (0–12)

- No independent account.  
- May attend **family / children-friendly** volunteer-style experiences only when:
  - A parent/guardian is the one interacting with the app  
  - The event is flagged kids-safe and family-appropriate  

Children are **never recorded as independent volunteers** in the system.

---

### 2.2 Youth (13–17)

Youth accounts (`role = individual/community`) may:

✅ See youth-appropriate volunteer opportunities, including:  
- Farms  
- Sanctuaries and rescues  
- Educational institutions that pass moderation and age rules  

✅ Register themselves as volunteers **only** for events explicitly flagged as:

- `volunteer = true`  
- `youth_appropriate = true`  
- Not a job or compensated role  

They **cannot**:

❌ Access any paid roles through volunteer flows  
❌ See RFQ, bid, or procurement details  
❌ Message vendors/institutions freely outside approved channels  

> Youth volunteer = protected civic participation,  
> **not** early labor exploitation.

---

### 2.3 Adults (18+)

Adults may:

- View and register for any public, approved volunteer events  
- Interact with hosts according to normal messaging + event rules  

Adults who own or manage providers (vendor/institution) may:

- Host volunteer events under the rules of this law  

---

## 3. Sanctuaries vs Institutions vs Vendors (Volunteer-Specific Rules)

Volunteer rules are aligned with your sanctuary, nonprofit, and institution law.

### 3.1 Sanctuaries / Rescues / Nonprofits

Sanctuaries / rescues:

✅ May host **volunteer events only**  
✅ May appear as hosts in:
- Volunteer map
- Volunteer lists
- Kids Explore (if kids-safe)

❌ May not:

- Wrap volunteer events in any financial transaction  
- Attach donations or fundraising flows inside Kids Mode  
- Turn volunteer events into paid “educational packages” in Kids Mode  

> Sanctuary volunteer =  
> “Come help, learn, care for animals,”  
> not “buy tickets / pay for a package.”

### 3.2 Institutions

Institutions (schools, universities, civic organizations):

✅ May host volunteer events such as:

- School-related service  
- Community service days  
- After-school / weekend projects  

✅ May see volunteer registrations at the institution level (admin views)  

❌ May not:

- Target minors in Kids Mode with recruitment language  
- Convert youth volunteer flows into paid or political engagement  

> Institutional volunteering =  
> “Help your community / school / city,”  
> not opaque recruitment.

---

### 3.3 Vendors (Non-Sanctuary)

Vendors:

✅ May host volunteer events, including:

- Farm volunteer days  
- Market help days  
- Community cleanup events  

✅ May surface in Kids Explore as learning opportunities if:

- Provider passes kids-safe rules  
- Events are properly flagged  

❌ May not:

- Use “volunteer” events to circumvent wages  
- Attach donation or sales flows in Kids Mode  

> Volunteer with vendors must remain clearly non-commercial in youth contexts.

## 4. Enforcement

Violations of this law (e.g., wage theft, misclassification, exploitation) may result in:

- Immediate removal of volunteer features  
- Suspension or termination of provider account  
- Permanent ban for repeat or severe misuse  
- Escalation via community and institutional governance  

Volunteer systems are governed as **trust infrastructure**,  
not growth or revenue funnels.
