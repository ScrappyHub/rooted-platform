## 1. Who Can Host Volunteer Opportunities?

Volunteer opportunities are events, not jobs, not gigs, not paid shifts.

Allowed volunteer hosts (Community vertical):

✅ Vendors:

Farms

Sanctuaries (mission-only)

Markets, orchards, food vendors, etc. (when configured)

✅ Institutions:

Schools

Universities

Libraries

Community centers

Nonprofits

✅ Sanctuaries / rescues / nonprofits:

As mission entities (no commercial compensation attached)

Not allowed to host volunteers in Community vertical:

❌ Purely backend institutions (e.g. infrastructure-only municipals)

❌ Any provider that is not in good standing / suspended / locked

❌ Any provider attempting to combine “volunteer” with hidden paid work

Volunteer = community contribution.
Not a stealth labor market.

## 2. Who Can Join Volunteer Opportunities?

We line this up with your age + account rules.

2.1 Children (0–12)

No independent account.

May attend volunteer-style experiences only when:

A parent/guardian is the one interacting with the app.

The event is flagged as family / children friendly.

Children are never recorded as independent volunteers in the system.

2.2 Youth (13–17)

Youth accounts (role = individual/community) may:

✅ See youth-appropriate volunteer opportunities:

Farms

Sanctuaries / rescues

Educational institutions that pass moderation & age rules

✅ Register themselves as volunteers only for:

Events flagged explicitly as:

youth-appropriate, and

volunteer, not “work” or “job”.

❌ They cannot:

Access any paid roles through volunteer flows.

See internal RFQ/bid-level details.

Message vendors/institutions directly outside approved channels.

Youth volunteer = protected civic participation, not early labor exploitation.

2.3 Adults (18+)

Adults may:

View and register for all volunteer events that are public & approved.

Interact with hosts according to normal messaging + event rules.

Adults may also:

Host volunteer events if they are owners of providers (vendor/institution).

## 3. Sanctuaries vs Institutions vs Vendors (Volunteer-Specific Rules)

We now align volunteer logic with your sanctuary + institution law.

3.1 Sanctuaries / Rescues / Nonprofits

Sanctuaries:

✅ May host volunteer events only.

✅ May appear as hosts in:

Volunteer map

Volunteer lists

Kids Explore (if kids-safe)

❌ May not:

Wrap volunteer events in any financial transaction.

Attach donations or fundraising mechanisms directly in Kids Mode.

Turn volunteer events into “institutional educational experiences” that are billed.

So:

Sanctuary volunteer =
“Come help, learn, care for animals,”
not “buy tickets / pay for a package.”

3.2 Institutions

Institutions (schools, universities, etc.):

✅ May host volunteer events:

School-related

Community service

After-school or weekend projects

✅ May see volunteer registrations at institution level (admin views).

❌ May not:

Target kids in Kids Mode with recruitment-style language.

Convert volunteer flows with minors into paid or political engagement.

Volunteer with institutions is:

“Help your community / school / city,”
not “be recruited into something opaque.”

3.3 Vendors (non-sanctuary)

Vendors:

✅ May host volunteer events:

Farm volunteer days

Market help days

Community cleanups, etc.

✅ May surface in Kids Explore as learning if events & provider are kids-safe.

❌ May not:
Use “volunteer events” to circumvent wages.

Attach donation/sales flows in Kids Mode
