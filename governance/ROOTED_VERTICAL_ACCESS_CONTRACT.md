1. Single Account Law (Non-Negotiable)

One human → One ROOTED identity

No vertical may create:

Additional accounts

Shadow usernames

Alternate email identities

All access routes through user_tiers.

---

2. Vertical Access Feature Flags (Lawful Mechanism)

Each vertical requires explicit access flags such as:

vertical_community_access

vertical_education_access

vertical_construction_access

vertical_experiences_access

vertical_arts_culture_access

Discovery may be visible without flags.
Creation, dashboards, RFQs, bids, analytics, and bulk MUST require flags.

🚫 Frontend may NEVER invent flags.

---

3. Trust-Based Invites Across Verticals

Examples:

Community → Experiences

Education → Experiences

Volunteer → Creator

These upgrades must:

Be Admin-confirmed OR automation-approved under governance.

Set feature flags explicitly.

Never bypass:

Kids Mode

Sanctuaries

Tier law

---

4. Kids Mode & Non-Commercial Binding

No vertical may monetize Kids Mode.

No analytics may be exposed.

Content may flow in, never pressure flows out.

---

5. Admins, Institutions & 2FA

Admins are global but law-bound.

Institutions must run with elevated security (2FA).

Enforcement MUST exist in:

Frontend redirects

Backend RLS

RPC validation

Failure = Platform governance breach.

---

6. Change Control

Any modification to:

Flags

Invite logic

Vertical boundaries

Requires updating:
