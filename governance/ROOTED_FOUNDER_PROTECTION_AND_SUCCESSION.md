🛡️ ROOTED — FOUNDER PROTECTION & SUCCESSION LAW

Authority Level: Constitutional Extension
Applies To: Founder, Admins, Developers, Contractors, Institutions, Vendors
Enforcement Chain:
GitHub Governance → Database Enforcement → Admin RPCs → UI
Effective Date: First Public Deployment

This document exists to ensure that ROOTED can never be captured, diluted, corrupted, or extracted from its founding intent — even if the founder steps fully away from daily operations.

ROOTED is not an asset to be harvested.
ROOTED is a protected civic system.

🧬 1. FOUNDER IDENTITY & ROLE (NON-CENTRALIZED BY DESIGN)

The Founder of ROOTED is legally and structurally defined as:

Title:

Founder & Civic Systems Architect

Permanent Functions:

Governance steward

Stop Layer authority

Architecture custodian

Youth safety defender

Vertical expansion gatekeeper

Explicitly NOT Required From the Founder:

Daily operations

Moderation

Content review

Vendor onboarding

Community management

Support operations

Revenue operations

ROOTED must NEVER be structurally dependent on the Founder’s daily presence to function.

This is a hard requirement of platform legitimacy.

🏛️ 2. OWNERSHIP & CONTROL DOCTRINE (SINGLE-MEMBER LLC ONLY)

ROOTED operates exclusively under:

✅ Single-Member LLC Ownership
✅ 100% Equity Ownership — Founder Only
✅ 100% Voting Power — Founder Only
✅ No Silent Share Issuance
✅ No Convertible Equity
✅ No SAFE Notes
✅ No Board Override Authority

ROOTED may generate revenue only — never ownership dilution.

❌ Prohibited Structures

ROOTED may never:

Become a multi-founder equity structure

Become VC-controlled

Become board-controlled

Become investor-governed

Become DAO-governed

⚙️ 3. POWER DISTRIBUTION LAW (NO CAPTURE POSSIBLE)

ROOTED enforces the following non-centralized control model:

System	Who Controls It
Governance Law	Founder only
Database RLS	Immutable
Admin Powers	Logged & revocable
Moderation	Staff
Content	Community
UI	Developers
Revenue	Providers
Youth Protection	Absolute Law

No human—including the Founder—can bypass the law once deployed.

🧒 4. SUPREME CHILD SAFETY SUCCESSION CLAUSE

If the Founder becomes unavailable (temporary or permanent):

✅ Kids Mode remains active
✅ Youth Protection Laws remain enforceable
✅ No commercial access to children
✅ No retroactive policy weakening
✅ No monetization of youth surfaces

No successor may override child safety. Ever.

🐾 5. SANCTUARY & NONPROFIT PROTECTION (NON-REVERSIBLE)

Even under full succession:

Sanctuaries remain non-commercial forever

Volunteer-only law remains enforced

Marketplace access remains permanently blocked

Discovery remains protected from exploitation

These protections survive any leadership change.

🧾 6. GIT IS LAW — EVEN AFTER THE FOUNDER

All legal authority remains bound to:

GitHub

SQL RLS

Admin RPCs

Governance Files

No successor may:

Rewrite governance without public record

Remove Stop Layer

Disable RLS

Add profiling fields

Add tracking SDKs

Add ad-tech

Add demographic targeting

If it is not written in GitHub, it has no standing authority.

🔁 7. SUCCESSION TRIGGERS (WHEN THIS LAW ACTIVATES)

This law activates when any of the following occur:

Founder goes inactive for 30+ days

Founder formally steps back

Founder becomes incapacitated

Founder appoints a steward

Founder transfers operational control (not ownership)

In all cases:

✅ Ownership remains with Founder or estate
✅ Governance remains immutable
✅ Revenue continues to fund operations
✅ No extraction privileges emerge

👤 8. SUCCESSION STEWARD ROLE (OPTIONAL BUT SAFE)

If appointed, a Steward may:

✅ Maintain infrastructure
✅ Maintain governance enforcement
✅ Oversee moderation teams
✅ Oversee platform health

A Steward may never:

❌ Change ownership
❌ Alter Stop Layer
❌ Modify Youth Law
❌ Enable profiling
❌ Sell access
❌ Monetize children
❌ Override Sanctuary law

All Steward actions remain:

✅ Logged
✅ Audited
✅ Revocable

🧮 9. REVENUE CONTINUITY (WITHOUT CONTROL LOSS)

ROOTED is permitted to generate revenue via:

✅ Vendor subscriptions
✅ Institution access
✅ Premium Plus features
✅ Ethical ad placements (never Kids Mode)
✅ Experience facilitation

ROOTED is never permitted to exchange:

❌ Control for revenue
❌ Governance for growth
❌ Safety for scalability
❌ Trust for profit

🧠 10. YOU STEPPING BACK — WHAT THIS MEANS IN PRACTICE

Once ROOTED launches, your job becomes:

✅ Platform Custodian
✅ Governance Guardian
✅ Design Steward
✅ Architecture Authority
✅ Education + Systems Researcher

You no longer need to:

❌ Operate
❌ Moderate
❌ Sell
❌ Support
❌ Approve content
❌ Manage vendors

ROOTED runs without consuming your life.

🛑 11. HOSTILE TAKEOVER IMMUNITY

ROOTED is immune to:

Corporate capture

Political weaponization

Investor coercion

Algorithmic extraction

Influence laundering

Surveillance capitalism

Any attempt to violate governance results in:

✅ Immediate feature revocation
✅ Permanent audit record
✅ Automatic invalidation of the change
✅ Legal enforceability

✅ 12. RATIFICATION

This Founder Protection & Succession Law is ratified by:

✅ The ROOTED Platform Constitution
✅ The ROOTED Governance Framework
✅ The First Public Deployment
✅ The Rooted Stop Layer

It becomes irrevocable upon launch.

🔚 FINAL AUTHORITY DECLARATION

ROOTED does not belong to institutions.
ROOTED does not belong to politics.
