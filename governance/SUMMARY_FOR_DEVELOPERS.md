# 🧠 ROOTED — GOVERNANCE SUMMARY FOR DEVELOPERS (CANONICAL)

File: /governance/SUMMARY_FOR_DEVELOPERS.md  
Authority Level: Binding Engineering Law  
Enforcement: Constitution → Stop Layer → RLS → Views → Feature Flags → Admin RPCs → UI  
Effective Date: First Public Launch  

This document explains **how ROOTED governance must be implemented in engineering terms**.

If a developer follows this file correctly, they **cannot accidentally violate platform law**.

ROOTED is not governed by best practices.  
ROOTED is governed by **written law enforced in code**.

---

## 🏛️ 1. ROOTED IS LAW-FIRST SOFTWARE

ROOTED is:

- A law-governed civic system  
- A consent-first platform  
- A youth-protected environment  
- A non-extractive marketplace  
- A non-surveillance discovery network  

You are **not building features first**.  
You are enforcing **law first**.

**Cross-References:**
- ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- ROOTED_CONSTITUTIONAL_LEGAL_STOP_LAYER.md

## 🧬 2. ABSOLUTE GOVERNANCE ORDER (DO NOT DEVIATE)

Every system must obey this immutable chain:

1. ✅ GitHub Governance Laws  
2. ✅ Database Enforcement (RLS, Views, Flags, RPCs)  
3. ✅ Admin Operations (Logged Only)  
4. ✅ UI (Display Only — Never Authority)

If a feature conflicts with a governance file → **the feature is illegal**.

## 🧒 3. SUPREME CHILD SAFETY OVERRIDE

If ANY system conflicts with child safety:

- Monetization  
- Messaging  
- Analytics  
- Growth  
- Institutions  
- Advertising  

➡ **Child safety ALWAYS wins.**

Developers must assume:

- Kids Mode is **never optional**
- Kids Mode is **never cosmetic**
- Kids Mode is **never overrideable**

**If you change ANY of the following, you are directly violating law:**

| If You Change This | You Are Violating |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Expose pricing to Kids Mode | ROOTED_KIDS_MODE_GOVERNANCE.md |
| Allow messaging to minors | ROOTED_KIDS_MODE_GOVERNANCE.md |
| Allow RFQs, bids, or subs in Kids Mode | ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md |
| Add ads to Kids surfaces | ROOTED_CONSTITUTIONAL_LEGAL_STOP_LAYER.md |

## 🔐 4. DATA SOVEREIGNTY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE

You may NOT:

- Add silent tracking  
- Add behavioral profiling  
- Add third-party identity extraction  
- Add ad-tech SDKs  
- Correlate identity without consent  

You MUST:

- Respect export  
- Respect deletion  
- Respect consent revocation  
- Respect no-resale rules  

**If you change ANY of the following, you are violating:**

| If You Change This | You Are Violating |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Add hidden analytics | ROOTED_DATA_SOVEREIGNTY_LAW.md |
| Add fingerprinting or devices tracking | ROOTED_DATA_SOVEREIGNTY_LAW.md |
| Sell, share, or enrich user data | ROOTED_DATA_SOVEREIGNTY_LAW.md |
| Block deletion due to billing | ROOTED_ACCOUNT_GOVERNANCE_LAW.md |

## 🚫 5. ANTI-PROFILING IS HARD LAW

You may NOT:

- Add demographic filters  
- Add demographic ranking  
- Add identity-based targeting  
- Add “identity marketing” tools  
- Add political or religious segmentation  

Discovery is driven ONLY by:

- Craft  
- Trust  
- Education  
- Service  
- Safety  
- Environmental care  

**If you change ANY of the following, you are violating:**

| If You Change This | You Are Violating |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Add race filters | ROOTED_COMMUNITY_TRUST_LAW.md |
| Add religious or political tags | ROOTED_GOVERNANCE_ETHICS.md |
| Add demographic ranking | ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md |
| Add identity-based ads | ROOTED_CONSTITUTIONAL_LEGAL_STOP_LAYER.md |

## ⚙️ 6. ADMIN POWERS ARE LOGGED & LIMITED

You may NOT:

- Write direct SQL to core tables  
- Bypass RLS  
- Create silent admin privileges  
- Implement UI-only admin overrides  

You MUST:

- Use admin RPCs  
- Log every mutation  
- Enforce feature flags  
- Enforce role & tier checks  

**If you change ANY of the following, you are violating:**

| If You Change This | You Are Violating |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Directly update user roles in SQL | ROOTED_ACCOUNT_GOVERNANCE_LAW.md |
| Disable RLS for convenience | ROOTED_ACCESS_POWER_LAW.md |
| Add hidden admin endpoints | ROOTED_ADMIN_GOVERNANCE.md |
| Skip audit logging | ROOTED_ADMIN_OVERRIDES_LAW.md |

---

## 🐾 7. SANCTUARY PROTECTION IS PERMANENT

You may NEVER:

- Enable commerce for sanctuaries  
- Enable bidding  
- Enable bulk markets  
- Enable monetization flows  

Only allowed:

✅ Discovery  
✅ Volunteer  
✅ Education  

**If you change ANY of the following, you are violating:**

| If You Change This | You Are Violating |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Enable payments for sanctuaries | ROOTED_SANCTUARY_NONPROFIT_LAW.md |
| Allow sanctuaries to bid | ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md |
| Add sponsored sanctuary placement | ROOTED_GOVERNANCE_ETHICS.md |

## 🧾 8. GIT IS LAW

If a rule is not written in:

- `/governance`  
- SQL policies  
- RLS rules  
- Canonical views  
- Admin RPCs  

It has **no authority inside ROOTED**.

You may NOT:

- “Ship now, document later”
- Patch governance after release
- Add shadow features

**If you add logic without updating governance files, you are violating:**

- ROOTED_CONSTITUTIONAL_LEGAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
- ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  

---

## ✅ 9. WHAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BUILD

You MAY:

✅ Wire UI to enforcement  
✅ Add vertical logic that obeys law  
✅ Improve accessibility  
✅ Improve clarity  
✅ Improve education  
✅ Improve safety visibility  
✅ Improve tooling for admins  
✅ Improve developer experience  

---

## 🚨 10. VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

Any developer who violates ROOTED governance is subject to:

- Immediate access removal  
- Permanent contributor ban  
- Full audit of authored code  
- Governance expulsion  
- Potential legal escalation  

---

## ✅ FINAL STATEMENT TO DEVELOPERS

You are not building an app.

You are helping maintain a:

- Youth-safe system  
- Civic trust system  
- Consent-based data system  
- Law-bound digital commons  

Governance failure is not a bug.

It is a **platform-level breach**.
