# 🧠 ROOTED — GOVERNANCE SUMMARY FOR DEVELOPERS (CANONICAL)

This document explains **how ROOTED governance must be implemented in engineering terms**.

If a developer follows this file correctly, they **cannot accidentally violate platform law**.

ROOTED is not governed by best practices.
ROOTED is governed by **written law enforced in code.**

---

## 🏛️ 1. ROOTED IS LAW-FIRST SOFTWARE

ROOTED is:

- A law-governed civic system  
- A consent-first platform  
- A youth-protected environment  
- A non-extractive marketplace  
- A non-surveillance discovery network  

You are **not building features first**.
You are enforcing **law first**.

---

## 🧬 2. ABSOLUTE GOVERNANCE ORDER (DO NOT DEVIATE)

Every system must obey this chain:

1. ✅ GitHub governance files  
2. ✅ Database enforcement (RLS, Views, Flags, RPCs)  
3. ✅ Admin operations (logged only)  
4. ✅ UI (display only, never authority)

If a feature conflicts with a governance file → the feature is illegal.

---

## 🧒 3. SUPREME CHILD SAFETY OVERRIDE

If ANY system conflicts with child safety:

- Monetization
- Messaging
- Analytics
- Growth
- Institutions
- Advertising

➡ Child safety ALWAYS wins.

As a developer, you must assume:

- Kids Mode is **never optional**
- Kids Mode is **never cosmetic**
- Kids Mode is **never overrideable**

---

## 🔐 4. DATA SOVEREIGNTY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE

You may NOT:

- Add silent tracking
- Add behavioral profiling
- Add third-party identity extraction
- Add ad-tech SDKs
- Correlate identity without consent

You MUST:

- Respect export
- Respect deletion
- Respect consent revocation
- Respect no-resale rules

---

## 🚫 5. ANTI-PROFILING IS HARD LAW

You may NOT:

- Add demographic filters
- Add demographic ranking
- Add identity-based targeting
- Add “identity marketing” tools
- Add political or religious segmentation

Discovery is driven ONLY by:

- Craft
- Trust
- Education
- Service
- Safety
- Environmental care

---

## ⚙️ 6. ADMIN POWERS ARE LOGGED & LIMITED

You may NOT:

- Write direct SQL to core tables
- Bypass RLS
- Create silent admin privileges
- Implement UI-only admin overrides

You MUST:

- Use admin RPCs
- Log every mutation
- Enforce feature flags
- Enforce role & tier checks

---

## 🐾 7. SANCTUARY PROTECTION IS PERMANENT

You may NEVER:

- Enable commerce for sanctuaries
- Enable bidding
- Enable bulk markets
- Enable monetization flows

Only:

✅ Discovery  
✅ Volunteer  
✅ Education  

---

## 🧾 8. GIT IS LAW

If a rule is not written in:

- `/governance`
- SQL policies
- RLS rules
- Canonical views
- Admin RPCs

It has **no authority inside ROOTED**.

You may NOT:

- “Ship now, document later”
- Patch governance after release
- Add shadow features

---

## ✅ 9. WHAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BUILD

You MAY:

✅ Wire UI to enforcement  
✅ Add vertical logic that obeys law  
✅ Improve accessibility  
✅ Improve clarity  
✅ Improve education  
✅ Improve safety visibility  
✅ Improve tooling for admins  
✅ Improve developer experience  

---

## 🚨 10. VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

Any developer who violates ROOTED governance is subject to:

- Immediate access removal  
- Permanent contributor ban  
- Full audit of authored code  
- Governance expulsion  
- Potential legal escalation  

---

## ✅ FINAL STATEMENT TO DEVELOPERS

You are not building an app.

You are helping maintain a:

- Youth-safe system
- Civic trust system
- Consent-based data system
- Law-bound digital commons

Governance failure is not a bug.

It is a **platform-level breach**.
