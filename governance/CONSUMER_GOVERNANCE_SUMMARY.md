# 🌱 ROOTED — CONSUMER GOVERNANCE & TRUST SUMMARY

ROOTED is a **community-first, safety-first civic platform** designed to help people discover:

- Local farms  
- Markets  
- Makers  
- Schools  
- Sanctuaries  
- Institutions  
- Volunteer opportunities  
- Educational experiences  

ROOTED is **not** a social media platform, an advertising network, or a data-mining company.

This page explains, in plain language, what ROOTED **guarantees** to every person who uses it.

## 🧒 CHILD SAFETY IS THE HIGHEST LAW

Children are never treated as a market.

In ROOTED:

- ✅ No ads are shown to children  
- ✅ No buying or selling is shown to children  
- ✅ No fundraising is shown to children  
- ✅ No business messaging is allowed to children  
- ✅ No political content is shown to children  
- ✅ No adult-only content is shown to children  

Kids Mode is not a “setting.”  
It is a **hard safety system built into the platform itself**.

If anything ever conflicts with child safety → **child safety always wins.**

## 🔐 YOU OWN YOUR DATA — NOT ROOTED

ROOTED does **not** sell user data. Ever.

You always have the right to:

- ✅ See your data  
- ✅ Download your data  
- ✅ Correct your data  
- ✅ Delete your data  
- ✅ Revoke your consent  

ROOTED does **not**:

- Track you invisibly  
- Sell your behavior  
- Share your identity with ad networks  
- Build hidden profiles about you  

---

## 🚫 NO PROFILING, NO LABELING, NO TARGETING

ROOTED does not sort people or businesses by:

- Race  
- Religion  
- Politics  
- Identity  
- Gender  
- Belief  
- Demographics  

ROOTED does **not** divide people into “markets.”

Instead, ROOTED surfaces:

- Real stories  
- Real work  
- Community impact  
- Education  
- Service  
- Trust & safety standing  

You are discovered for **who you are and how you serve**, not what label you fit.

## 🐾 SANCTUARIES & NONPROFITS ARE PROTECTED

Animal sanctuaries, rescues, and mission-only nonprofits:

- ❌ Cannot be monetized  
- ❌ Cannot sell access  
- ❌ Cannot be forced into commerce  
- ✅ Can host volunteer opportunities  
- ✅ Can offer educational programs  
- ✅ Are protected from commercial exploitation  

Their presence on ROOTED is for **public good only**.

## ⚙️ ADMIN POWER IS LIMITED & AUDITED

No one inside ROOTED has unlimited power.

That includes:

- Admins  
- Developers  
- Staff  
- The Founder  

Every serious action is:

- ✅ Logged  
- ✅ Audited  
- ✅ Reviewable  
- ✅ Bound by written platform law  

There are **no secret overrides**.

---

## 🧾 NO SILENT RULE CHANGES

Every rule that affects:

- Safety  
- Data  
- Kids Mode  
- Discovery  
- Monetization  
- Admin power  

Must be written in public governance files.

If a rule is not written down → **it has no authority inside ROOTED.**

✅ A local discovery system  
✅ A volunteer coordination network  
✅ An educational platform  
✅ A civic & cultural map  
✅ A youth-safe environment

---

## 🚫 WHAT ROOTED IS NOT

ROOTED is **not**:

❌ A social media addiction engine  
❌ A surveillance platform  
❌ A political tool  
❌ A data-extraction system  
❌ A pay-to-win marketplace  
❌ A platform for targeting people by identity  

---

## 👤 THE FOUNDER DOES NOT HAVE UNLIMITED POWER

The Founder:

- Owns the platform  
- Protects the governance  
- Architected the system  

But:

- ❌ Cannot override Kids Mode  
- ❌ Cannot override data sovereignty  
- ❌ Cannot monetize children  
- ❌ Cannot silently change safety rules  

ROOTED is **law-governed, not personality-governed**.

---

- Makers  
- Volunteers  
- Institutions  
- Communities  

ROOTED will never trade:

- Safety for growth  
- Trust for profit  
- Consent for convenience

This platform is built for the long term.

For people — not for extraction.
