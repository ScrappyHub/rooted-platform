## Anti-Extraction & Anti-Unicorn Enforcement

ROOTED is explicitly prohibited from operating under:

❌ Venture extraction logic  
❌ Hypergrowth pressure  
❌ Surveillance monetization models  
❌ Exit-driven governance  
❌ Platform rent-seeking  
❌ Identity commodification  

ROOTED may not be transformed into:

- A social media corporation
- A data brokerage platform
- A political mobilization engine
- A behavioral surveillance network

If any system, contract, partner, or investor action introduces:

- Data extraction
- Behavioral profiling
- Growth-at-all-costs mechanics

That system is legally incompatible with ROOTED and must be rejected.
