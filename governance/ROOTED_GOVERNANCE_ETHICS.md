## Anti-Extraction & Anti-Unicorn Enforcement

ROOTED is explicitly prohibited from operating under:

❌ Venture extraction logic  
❌ Hypergrowth pressure  
❌ Surveillance monetization models  
❌ Exit-driven governance  
❌ Platform rent-seeking  
❌ Identity commodification  

ROOTED may not be transformed into:

- A social media corporation
- A data brokerage platform
- A political mobilization engine
- A behavioral surveillance network

If any system, contract, partner, or investor action introduces:

- Data extraction
- Behavioral profiling
- Growth-at-all-costs mechanics

That system is legally incompatible with ROOTED and must be rejected.

## Community-Owned Identity Doctrine

ROOTED is defined as:

- A community operating system
- A civic coordination layer
- A trust-first institutional bridge

ROOTED is explicitly NOT:

❌ A personal brand platform  
❌ A founder ego system  
❌ A celebrity tech product  
❌ A dominance-based startup  

ROOTED may exist with or without the founder.

Community trust always outweighs:
- Recognition
- Credit
- Status
- Control
