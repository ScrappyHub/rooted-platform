## 1. TRUST IS A PREREQUISITE FOR VISIBILITY

No entity may appear publicly in ROOTED unless:

✅ Identity is verifiable  
✅ Content is moderated (where required)  
✅ Status is approved  
✅ Account is active  
✅ Discoverability is explicitly enabled  

There are **no shadow publishes**.  
Drafts and unreviewed content are never publicly visible.

**Cross-Reference:** ROOTED_COMMUNITY_TRUST_LAW.md  

---

## 2. MODERATION AS A FIRST-CLASS SYSTEM

All public-facing entities must flow through:

- `public.moderation_queue`

Including:

- Providers  
- Institutions  
- Events  
- Landmarks  
- Volunteer programs  
- (Future) Community content  

No discovery view, feed, map, or search result may surface:

- Draft content  
- Unreviewed content  
- Rejected content  

Moderation is a **core system**, not an afterthought.

## 3. CHILD SAFETY SUPERCEDES ALL OTHER PRIORITIES

If any system, feature, or decision conflicts with Kids Mode safety:

➡ **Kids safety always wins.**

This supersedes:

- Revenue  
- Growth  
- Ads and sponsorships  
- Analytics goals  
- Institutional pressure  
- Investor pressure  

There is **no appeal path** that overrides child safety or consent law.

## 4. MISUSE OF TRUST (PERMANENT BAN TRIGGERS)

The following behaviors permanently ban an entity from ROOTED:

- Predatory behavior  
- Targeting minors commercially  
- Safety or compliance manipulation  
- Fraud or deception at scale  
- Abuse of volunteer systems  
- Exploitation of emergencies or disasters  

ROOTED may:

- Remove any account  
- Revoke any feature set  
- Permanently ban any entity  

…whenever trust or safety is compromised.

## 5. TRAUMA-INFORMED SAFETY ARCHITECTURE

ROOTED’s safety systems exist specifically to prevent real-world failures such as:

- Family systems collapsing without support  
- Institutions failing children or vulnerable people  
- Communities losing coordination in emergencies  
- Abuse going unobserved due to systemic blind spots  

All design decisions affecting:

- Kids Mode  
- Volunteer systems  
- Institutions  
- Messaging  
- Discovery  
- Moderation  

Must be evaluated through:

✅ Power imbalance analysis  
✅ Consent asymmetry analysis  
✅ Abuse risk modeling  
✅ Child safety precedence  

If a feature **increases exploitability**, it must be blocked —  
even if it reduces growth, engagement, or revenue.

## 6. ANTI-PROFILING & NON-IDENTITY SORTING ETHICS

This section anchors the *ethical doctrine* that is fully codified in ROOTED_COMMUNITY_TRUST_LAW.md.

ROOTED:

- Does **not** sort people into demographic funnels  
- Does **not** sell identity  
- Does **not** allow identity-based discovery or ranking  
- Surfaces **work, story, trust, and community impact** instead  

Ethical doctrine:

> “Tell us your story.  
>  Show how you serve.  
>  Let the community decide to visit you — not because of labels, but because of trust.”

Implementation of these rules is fully bound by:

- ROOTED_COMMUNITY_TRUST_LAW.md (Anti-Profiling Law)  
- ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md

## 7. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS

This Governance & Ethics Law works together with:

- ROOTED_DATA_SOVEREIGNTY_LAW.md  
- ROOTED_ACCESS_POWER_LAW.md  
- ROOTED_COMMUNITY_TRUST_LAW.md  
- ROOTED_KIDS_MODE_GOVERNANCE.md  
- ROOTED_SANCTUARY_NONPROFIT_LAW.md

- Moderation authority  
- Anti-surveillance  
- Anti-exploitation  
- Anti-power abuse

## 8. FINAL STATEMENT

ROOTED does not exist to extract value from people.  
ROOTED exists to **protect, connect, and uplift**:

- Humans  
- Families  
- Workers  
- Farmers  
- Teachers  
- Makers  
- Healers  
- Builders  

Not labels.  
Not demographic categories.  
Not markets of identity.

Ethics are not a theme in ROOTED.  
They are **law backed by code**.
