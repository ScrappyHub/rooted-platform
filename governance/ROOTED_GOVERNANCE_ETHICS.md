# 🧩 ROOTED — Governance & Ethics Law

Authority Level: Canonical Platform Law  
Enforcement: Constitution → Stop Layer → Database (RLS + Views + Flags) → UI  
Effective Date: First Public Launch  

This file defines the **ethical baseline** for how ROOTED treats people, businesses, and communities.

---

## 1. Trust Is a Prerequisite for Visibility

No entity may appear publicly in ROOTED unless:

- ✅ Identity is verifiable  
- ✅ Content is moderated (where required)  
- ✅ Status is approved  
- ✅ Account is active  
- ✅ Discoverability is explicitly enabled  

There are **no shadow publishes**. Drafts and unreviewed content are never publicly visible.

---

## 2. Moderation as a First-Class System

All public-facing entities must flow through:

- `public.moderation_queue`

Including:

- Providers  
- Institutions  
- Events  
- Landmarks  
- Volunteer programs  
- (Future) Community content  

No discovery view, feed, map, or search result may surface:

- Draft content  
- Unreviewed content  
- Rejected content

## 3. Child Safety Supersedes All Other Priorities

If any system, feature, or decision conflicts with Kids Mode safety:

➡ **Kids safety always wins.**

This overrides:

- Revenue  
- Growth  
- Ads and sponsorships  
- Analytics goals  
- Institutional pressure  
- Investor pressure  

There is **no appeal path** that overrides child safety or consent law.

- `ROOTED_CONSTITUTIONAL_LEGAL_STOP_LAYER.md`

## 4. Misuse of Trust (Permanent Ban Triggers)

The following behaviors permanently ban an entity from ROOTED:

- Predatory behavior  
- Targeting minors commercially  
- Safety or compliance manipulation  
- Fraud or deception at scale  
- Abuse of volunteer systems  
- Exploitation of emergencies or disasters  

ROOTED may:

- Remove any account  
- Revoke any feature set  
- Permanently ban any entity  

…when trust or safety is compromised. 

---

## 5. Trauma-Informed Safety Architecture

ROOTED’s safety systems exist specifically to prevent real-world failures such as:

- Family systems collapsing without support  
- Institutions failing children or vulnerable people  
- Communities losing coordination in emergencies  
- Abuse going unobserved due to systemic blind spots  

All design decisions affecting:

- Kids Mode  
- Volunteer systems  
- Institutions  
- Messaging  
- Discovery  
- Moderation  

Must be evaluated through:

- ✅ Power imbalance analysis  
- ✅ Consent asymmetry analysis  
- ✅ Abuse risk modeling  
- ✅ Child safety precedence  

If a feature increases exploitability, it must be blocked —  
even if it reduces growth, engagement, or revenue.

## 6. Anti-Profiling & Non-Identity Sorting Law

**Authority Level:** Absolute Platform Law  
**Enforcement:** Constitution → RLS → Views → Feature Flags → UI  

### 6.1 Absolute Ban on Demographic Profiling

ROOTED does **not** permit profiling, segmentation, or filtering of people or businesses by:

- Race  
- Ethnicity  
- Skin color  
- National origin  
- Religion  
- Political belief  
- Gender identity  
- Sexual orientation  
- Family structure  
- Immigration status  
- Disability status  

These attributes:

- ✅ Are never required  
- ✅ Are never inferred  
- ✅ Are never requested  
- ✅ Are never used for ranking  
- ✅ Are never used in discovery  
- ✅ Are never used as analytics buckets  

ROOTED does **not** categorize humans.  
ROOTED surfaces **stories, work, and community impact**.

---

### 6.2 No Identity-Based Business Labeling

Businesses and institutions inside ROOTED:

❌ May NOT self-identify using:

- Racial labels  
- Political alignment  
- Religious alignment (outside explicit, opt-in cultural sets)  
- Demographic marketing tags  

✅ Businesses are surfaced by:

- What they do  
- How they serve  
- Their story  
- Their trust & safety standing  
- Their compliance  
- Their community impact  

Not by identity marketing.

---

### 6.3 Story Over Segmentation Principle (Core Doctrine)

ROOTED operates under this doctrine:

> “Tell us your story.  
> Show how you serve.  
> Let the community decide to visit you — not because of labels, but because of trust.”

Discovery must be driven by:

- Craft  
- Ethics  
- Quality  
- Education  
- Service  
- Environmental care  
- Community contribution  

Not by demographic cues.

---

### 6.4 Enforcement Guarantees

This law is enforced through:

- ✅ No demographic columns in public discovery schemas  
- ✅ No demographic filters in search, map, or feeds  
- ✅ No demographic sorting in ranking algorithms  
- ✅ No ad targeting by identity attributes  
- ✅ No analytics based on identity segments  

Any attempt to introduce demographic profiling or identity sorting:

- Is automatically invalid  
- Must be rejected in code review  
- Must be blocked at RLS / view level  
- Must be removed from UI immediately  

---

### 6.5 Child Protection Interlock

Kids:

- Are never profiled  
- Are never segmented by demographic traits  
- Are never exposed to identity-driven marketing or labeling  

Kids Mode is allowed to show only:

- Education  
- Nature  
- Agriculture  
- Culture (opt-in, non-political, non-proselytizing)  

---

### 6.6 Violation Consequences

Any actor attempting to introduce profiling systems, identity sorting, or identity-based ads faces:

- Immediate feature revocation  
- Immediate discovery removal  
- Full internal audit  
- Permanent removal from governance or access  
- Possible external reporting depending on scope  

This applies equally to:

- Admins  
- Developers  
- Contractors  
- Partners  
- Founders  

No one is exempt.
