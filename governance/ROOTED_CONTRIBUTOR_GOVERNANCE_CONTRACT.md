# ROOTED CONTRIBUTOR & AI GOVERNANCE CONTRACT (CANONICAL v1)

By writing, modifying, reviewing, deploying, or generating ANY code, documentation, UI, SQL, automation, or governance material for ROOTED, you agree to be permanently bound by this contract.

This is not a suggestion.
This is operational law.

---

## 🛡️ 1. ROOTED IS GOVERNED SOFTWARE

ROOTED is not a startup product.
It is a:

- Youth-safe civic system
- Consent-bound data environment
- Law-first platform
- Non-extractive community network

You are not building features first.
You are enforcing law first.

---

## ⚖️ 2. HIERARCHY OF AUTHORITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All execution MUST follow this order:

1. ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md (supreme)
2. ROOTED_STOP_LAYER.md
3. Canonical governance law files
4. Database (RLS, Views, RPCs)
5. Admin UI
6. Frontend UI

If anything conflicts with this order → the higher layer wins instantly.

---

## 🧒 3. SUPREME CHILD SAFETY CLAUSE

You may NEVER:

- Enable monetization in Kids Mode
- Enable messaging to minors

- Enable analytics profiling on minors
- Enable uploads by minors without moderation

Kids Mode is:

✅ Mandatory  
✅ Non-optional  
✅ Non-cosmetic  
✅ Non-overridable  

Any violation = permanent platform breach.

---

## 🐾 4. SANCTUARY & NONPROFIT IMMUNITY

- RFQs
- Bids
- Bulk markets

This is not a feature.
This is constitutional protection.

---

## 🧬 7. VERTICAL GOVERNANCE LIMITS

All verticals inherit CORE without exception.

By continuing work on ROOTED you explicitly affirm:

- You understand this is a LAW-FIRST PLATFORM
- You accept that your access is revocable at any time
