📜 ROOTED PLATFORM CONSTITUTION 

Authority Level: Absolute Platform Law
Applies To: All users, vendors, institutions, staff, contractors, developers, and administrators
Enforcement Chain:
GitHub Governance → Database (RLS + Views + RPCs) → Admin Oversight → UI
Effective Date: Upon first public launch of ROOTED

🧭 PURPOSE OF THIS CONSTITUTION

ROOTED is not a typical application. It is a regional, civic, institutional, and community operating system.

This Constitution exists to ensure that ROOTED:

Cannot be ethically compromised as it scales

Cannot be captured by monetization-first incentives

Cannot be weaponized politically

Cannot exploit children, communities, or institutions

Cannot become a surveillance platform

Cannot bypass its own safety rules through UI tricks, admin abuse, or hidden data extraction

This Constitution is the highest governing authority inside ROOTED.

If any code, policy, contract, UI design, or business decision conflicts with this Constitution → the Constitution always wins.

🏛️ GOVERNANCE HIERARCHY (CHAIN OF AUTHORITY)

ROOTED is governed in the following strict order:

✅ GitHub Governance Files (Platform Law)

✅ Database Enforcement

Row Level Security (RLS)

Canonical Views

Feature Flags

Admin RPCs

✅ Admin Oversight

Moderation actions

Account governance

Feature flag management

✅ User Interface (UI)

Display layer only

Never an authority layer

If any layer conflicts with a higher layer, the higher layer overrides immediately.

🧮 PLATFORM ACCESS & FEATURE ENTITLEMENT LAW (TIER GRID — CANONICAL)

This section is now part of ROOTED_ACCESS_POWER_LAW and is legally binding platform-wide.

✅ CANONICAL FEATURE GRID (ENFORCED BY DB + RLS)
Role	Tier	Bid Market	Bulk Market	Basic Analytics	Advanced Analytics
Vendor	Free	❌	❌	✅	❌
Vendor	Premium	❌	✅	✅	❌
Vendor	Premium Plus	✅	✅	✅	✅
Institution	Free	❌	❌	✅	❌
Institution	Premium	❌	✅	✅	❌
Institution	Premium Plus	✅	✅	✅	✅
Admin	Any	✅	✅	✅	✅
🔒 Absolute Enforcement Rules

Premium does NOT include bidding. Ever.

Only Premium Plus may bid.

Basic analytics is free for everyone except community users.

Bulk marketplace is Premium and above.

Advanced analytics is Premium Plus only.

Admin always has full system access.

Any future code, UI, or contract that violates this grid is automatically invalid.

🏛️ INSTITUTION & VENDOR MIRROR LAW (EQUAL ACCESS GUARANTEE)

Institutions and Vendors are governed by the same access logic at the same tier level.

This means:

If vendors at Premium can access Bulk → institutions at Premium must also access Bulk

If vendors at Premium Plus can bid → institutions at Premium Plus must also bid

Analytics access is mirrored identically

UI, RLS, views, APIs, feature flags, and frontend gating must stay perfectly aligned

There shall never exist:

“Vendor-only privileged access”

“Institution-restricted monetization”

“Shadow paywalls by role”

This mirror rule is absolute and non-overrideable.

🛑 SANCTUARY & NONPROFIT COMMERCIAL RESTRICTION LAW

Sanctuaries, rescues, and mission-only nonprofits:

❌ May NOT access bidding

❌ May NOT access bulk marketplace

✅ May host volunteer-only events

✅ May appear in discovery

✅ Must pass full moderation

Their purpose is public good, never commerce.

🧾 ENFORCEMENT & LEGAL STANDING

Any action that violates one or more platform laws may result in:

Immediate feature revocation

Immediate discovery removal

Account suspension or termination

Permanent ban

Full internal audit

External legal escalation where applicable

No revenue source, sponsor, partner, or institution is exempt from enforcement.

🧑‍💼 DEVELOPER & CONTRIBUTOR BINDING CLAUSE

Any person who:

Writes code for ROOTED

Designs systems for ROOTED

Manages data for ROOTED

Administers ROOTED systems

Is legally and ethically bound by all files listed in this Constitution.

No contributor may claim:

Ignorance of governance

Business necessity

Investor pressure

Performance targets

As justification for violating ROOTED law.

🧠 INTENT PRESERVATION CLAUSE

ROOTED is designed to:

Strengthen local economies

Protect children

Support institutions

Prevent extractive technology models

If a proposal undermines this intent → it is automatically invalid.

🧬 CONSTITUTIONAL & LEGAL LAYER — ✅ PERMANENTLY LOCKED

These documents now function as platform law:

✅ ROOTED Platform Constitution

✅ Data Sovereignty & Consent Law

✅ Admin Power Limitation Law

✅ Community Trust & Safety Law

✅ Sanctuary & Nonprofit Protection Law

✅ Contributor Governance Notice

✅ Founder Non-Centralization Clause

✅ Ownership & Control Doctrine (Single-Member LLC Only)
