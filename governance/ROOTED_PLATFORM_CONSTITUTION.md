📜 ROOTED PLATFORM CONSTITUTION

Authority Level: Absolute Platform Law
Applies To: All users, vendors, institutions, staff, contractors, developers, and administrators
Enforcement: GitHub Governance → Database (RLS + Views + RPCs) → Admin Oversight → UI
Effective Date: Upon first public launch of ROOTED

🧭 PURPOSE OF THIS CONSTITUTION

ROOTED is not a typical application.
It is a regional, civic, institutional, and community operating system.

This Constitution exists to ensure that ROOTED:

Cannot be ethically compromised as it scales

Cannot be captured by monetization-first incentives

Cannot be weaponized politically

Cannot exploit children, communities, or institutions

Cannot become a surveillance platform

Cannot bypass its own safety rules through UI tricks, admin abuse, or hidden data extraction

This Constitution is the highest governing authority inside ROOTED.

If any code, policy, contract, UI design, or business decision conflicts with this Constitution →
the Constitution always wins.

🏛️ GOVERNANCE HIERARCHY (CHAIN OF AUTHORITY)

ROOTED is governed in the following strict order:

✅ GitHub Governance Files (Platform Law)

✅ Database Enforcement

Row Level Security (RLS)

Feature Flags

Admin RPCs

✅ Admin Oversight

Moderation actions

Account governance

Feature flag management

✅ User Interface (UI)

Display layer only

Never an authority layer

If any layer conflicts with a higher layer, the higher layer overrides immediately.
