## 🧭 PURPOSE

This law exists to ensure that:

👉 No human, account, service, or system inside ROOTED can ever possess unchecked power.

ROOTED explicitly rejects:

- Silent control  
- Shadow privileges  
- Unlogged overrides  
- “Founder exception” logic  
- Revenue-driven privilege escalation  

All power inside ROOTED must always be:

✅ Logged  
✅ Audited  
✅ Role-scoped  
✅ Tier-scoped  
✅ Feature-flag scoped  
✅ Time-bounded where possible  

---

## 👤 ADMIN POWER IS RESTRICTED BY LAW

Admins do NOT own ROOTED.  
They are stewards bound by this law.

Admins may act only through:

- RLS-protected tables  
- SECURITY DEFINER RPCs  
- Feature flag gates  
- Audit-logged operations  

Every admin action that mutates governance, access, safety, or monetization MUST write to:

- `public.user_admin_actions`  
- or a documented, append-only audit table  

---

## ✅ PERMITTED ADMIN ACTIONS (LOGGED ONLY)

Admins may perform:

- Role changes  
- Tier changes  
- Feature flag updates  
- Account suspensions or lockouts  
- Badge grants or revocations  
- Provider sanctions  
- Moderation approvals and rejections  

All permitted actions must be:

✅ Logged  
✅ Auditable  
✅ Reversible where possible  
✅ Reviewable by other admins  

---

## ❌ ABSOLUTE ADMIN PROHIBITIONS

Admins may NEVER:

- Bypass RLS via ad-hoc SQL for user-facing data  
- Grant commercial tools to prohibited entities (e.g., sanctuaries)  
- Override Kids Mode protections  
- Monetize children  
- Force holiday or cultural activation without consent  
- Silence lawful community activity for personal, political, or commercial gain  
- Inflate or manipulate analytics reporting  
- Manipulate discovery ranking for private deals  
- Deploy shadow features outside governance docs  
- Override moderation outcomes without trace  

👉 There are NO exceptions — including the Founder.

---

## 🧾 GIT-LOCKED AUTHORITY

All access rules must exist in:

- GitHub governance files  
- Supabase functions  
- RLS policies & migrations  

If a rule is NOT written in GitHub → it has NO legal authority inside ROOTED.

Git is the canonical record of:

- Laws  
- Migrations  
- Admin RPC definitions  
- RLS policies  

---

## 🧒 SUPREME CHILD SAFETY CLAUSE

If child safety ever conflicts with:

- Revenue  
- Growth  
- Analytics  
- Advertising  
- Institutional pressure  
- Investor pressure  

➡ CHILD SAFETY ALWAYS WINS. NO EXCEPTIONS.

Kids Mode monetization is PERMANENTLY banned.  
Landmarks and children’s attention may NEVER be sold.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ FOUNDER NON-CENTRALIZATION CLAUSE

ROOTED is NOT permitted to structurally depend on the Founder for:

- Daily operational control  
- Emergency override authority  
- Governance enforcement  
- Revenue gatekeeping  
- Platform identity or branding decisions  

The Founder:

- Must NOT be required for ROOTED to function  
- Must NOT be treated as a single point of failure  
- Must NOT be secretly granted special powers  
- Must be removable from admin roles without breaking the system  

All privilege inside ROOTED must be:

✅ Role-scoped  
✅ Logged  
✅ Audited  
✅ Revocable  

ROOTED is governed by LAW — not personality.  
No one is exempt.

---

## 🚨 ENFORCEMENT

Any unlogged or abusive use of power results in:

- Immediate privilege revocation  
- Forensic audit of affected data  
- Permanent governance removal  
- Legal escalation where applicable  

This law binds:

- Admins  
- Developers  
- Founders  
- Contractors  
- Service accounts  

---

## 🌐 SCOPE

This law applies across:

- ROOTED Core  
- ROOTED Community  
- All present and future verticals  

If any feature, vertical, partner, or actor attempts to bypass this law:

➡ This law wins.
