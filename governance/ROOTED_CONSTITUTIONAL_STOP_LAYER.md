## 🧒 SUPREME CHILD SAFETY CLAUSE (OVERRIDING LAW)

If child safety ever conflicts with:

- Revenue
- Growth
- Advertising
- Partnerships
- Institutional pressure
- Investor pressure

**Child safety ALWAYS wins. This clause overrides everything.**

## 🐾 SANCTUARY & NONPROFIT ABSOLUTE PROTECTION

Sanctuaries, rescues, and mission-only nonprofits:

❌ May NOT access commerce  
❌ May NOT access bidding  
❌ May NOT access bulk markets  
✅ May host volunteer & education events only  
✅ Always discovery-safe  
✅ Always moderation-required  

Their existence on ROOTED is for **public good only** — never profit.

## ⚙️ NO UNLIMITED POWER PRINCIPLE

No human, account, admin, or system process inside ROOTED may possess:

❌ Unlogged override authority  
❌ Silent access to restricted data  
❌ The ability to bypass:
- RLS
- Feature flags
- Moderation
- Kids Mode
- Compliance law

## 🧾 GIT IS LAW

All authority must exist in:

- SQL policies
- Exposed RPCs

If it is **not written in GitHub, it has no legal authority inside ROOTED**.
