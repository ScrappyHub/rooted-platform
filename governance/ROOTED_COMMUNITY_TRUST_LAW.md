## 1. TRUST IS A PREREQUISITE FOR VISIBILITY

No entity may appear publicly in ROOTED unless:

✅ Identity is verifiable  
✅ Content is moderated  
✅ Status is approved  
✅ Account is active  
✅ Discoverability is explicitly enabled  

There are **no “shadow publishes.”**

Drafts, unreviewed, or rejected content **must never** appear:

- In discovery views  
- In feeds  
- On maps  
- In search results  

---

## 2. MODERATION AS A FIRST-CLASS SYSTEM

All public-facing entities must flow through:

- `public.moderation_queue`

Including:

- Providers  
- Institutions  
- Events  
- Landmarks  
- Volunteer programs  
- (Future) Community content  

No discovery view, feed, map, or search result may surface:

- Draft content  
- Unreviewed content  
- Rejected content

## 3. CHILD SAFETY SUPERSEDES ALL OTHER PRIORITIES

If any system or feature ever conflicts with Kids Mode safety:

➡ **Kids safety always wins.**

This includes conflicts with:

- Revenue  
- Analytics  
- Growth  
- Marketing  
- Partnerships  
- Institutional pressure  
- Investor pressure  

There is **no appeal path** that can override child safety or consent law.

## 4. MISUSE OF TRUST (PERMANENT BAN TRIGGERS)

The following behaviors permanently ban an entity from ROOTED:

- Predatory behavior  
- Targeting minors commercially  
- Safety or compliance manipulation  
- Fraud or deception at scale  
- Abuse of volunteer systems  
- Exploitation of emergencies or disasters  

ROOTED reserves the right to:

- Remove any account  
- Revoke any feature set  
- Permanently ban any entity  

…**whenever trust or safety is compromised.**

There is **no appeal path** that overrides:

- Child safety law  
- Consent law  
- Sanctuary & nonprofit protection law

## 5. TRAUMA-INFORMED SAFETY ARCHITECTURE

ROOTED’s safety systems exist specifically to prevent the real-world failures that occur when:

- Family systems collapse  
- Institutions fail children or vulnerable people  
- Communities lose coordination  
- Abuse goes structurally unobserved  

All design decisions affecting:

- Kids Mode  
- Volunteer systems  
- Institutions  
- Messaging  
- Discovery  
- Moderation  

Must be evaluated through:

✅ Power imbalance analysis  
✅ Consent asymmetry analysis  
✅ Abuse risk modeling  
✅ Child safety precedence  

If any feature **increases exploitability**, it must be:

➡ Blocked — even if it reduces growth or revenue.

## 6. ROOTED ANTI-PROFILING & NON-IDENTITY SORTING LAW

Authority Level: Absolute Platform Law  
Enforcement: Constitution → RLS → Views → Feature Flags → UI  

This section is binding across all verticals and discovery surfaces.

### 6.1 Absolute Ban on Demographic Profiling

ROOTED does **not** permit profiling, segmentation, or filtering of people or businesses by:

- Race  
- Ethnicity  
- Skin color  
- National origin  
- Religion  
- Political belief  
- Gender identity  
- Sexual orientation  
- Family structure  
- Immigration status  
- Disability status  

These attributes:

✅ Are never required  
✅ Are never inferred  
✅ Are never requested  
✅ Are never used for ranking  
✅ Are never used for discovery  
✅ Are never stored as segmentation controls  

ROOTED does **not** categorize humans.  
ROOTED surfaces **stories, work, and community impact.**

---

### 6.2 No Identity-Based Business Labeling

Businesses and institutions inside ROOTED:

❌ May NOT self-identify using:

- Racial labels  
- Political alignment  
- Religious alignment (outside explicitly opted-in cultural/civic sets)  
- Demographic marketing tags  

✅ Businesses are surfaced by:

- What they do  
- How they serve  
- Their story  
- Their practices  
- Their trust & safety standing  
- Their community impact  

Not by identity targeting.

---

### 6.3 STORY OVER SEGMENTATION PRINCIPLE (CORE DOCTRINE)

ROOTED operates under this doctrine:

> “Tell us your story.  
>  Show how you serve.  
>  Let the community decide to visit you — not because of labels, but because of trust.”

Discovery must be driven by:

- Craft  
- Ethics  
- Quality  
- Education  
- Service  
- Environmental care  
- Community contribution  

Not by demographic cues.

---

### 6.4 Enforcement Guarantees

This law is enforced through:

✅ No demographic columns in public discovery schemas  
✅ No demographic filters in search, map, or feeds  
✅ No demographic sorting in ranking algorithms  
✅ No ad targeting by identity attributes  
✅ No analytics buckets by identity attributes  

Any attempt to introduce demographic profiling or identity sorting:

- Is **automatically invalid**  
- Must be rejected at code review  
- Must be blocked at RLS / view level  
- Must be removed from UI immediately  

---

### 6.5 Child Protection Interlock

Kids:

- Are never profiled  
- Are never segmented by demographic traits  
- Are never exposed to identity-driven marketing or labeling  

Kids Mode is allowed to show only:

- Education  
- Nature  
- Agriculture  
- Culture (opt-in, non-political, non-proselytizing)  

**Cross-Reference:** ROOTED_KIDS_MODE_GOVERNANCE.md  

---

### 6.6 Violation Consequences

Any actor attempting to introduce profiling systems, identity sorting, or identity-based ads faces:

- Immediate feature revocation  
- Immediate discovery removal  
- Full internal audit  
- Permanent removal from governance or platform access  
- Possible external reporting depending on scope  

This applies equally to:

- Admins  
- Developers  
- Contractors  
- Partners  
- Founders  

No one is exempt.
