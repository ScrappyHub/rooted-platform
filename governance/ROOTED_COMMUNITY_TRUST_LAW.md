## Trauma-Informed Safety Architecture

ROOTED’s safety systems exist specifically to prevent the real-world failures that occur when:

- Family systems collapse
- Institutions fail children
- Communities lose coordination
- Abuse goes structurally unobserved

All design decisions affecting:

- Kids Mode
- Volunteer systems
- Institutions
- Messaging
- Discovery
- Moderation

Must be evaluated through:

✅ Power imbalance analysis  
✅ Consent asymmetry analysis  
✅ Abuse risk modeling  
✅ Child safety precedence  

If any feature increases exploitability, it must be blocked—even if it reduces growth or revenue.

🚫 ROOTED ANTI-PROFILING & NON-IDENTITY SORTING LAW

Authority Level: Absolute Platform Law
Enforcement: Constitution → RLS → Views → Feature Flags → UI
Effective Date: Immediate

❌ ABSOLUTE BAN ON DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILING

ROOTED does not permit profiling, segmentation, or filtering of people or businesses by:

Race

Ethnicity

Skin color

National origin

Religion

Political belief

Gender identity

Sexual orientation

Family structure

Immigration status

Disability status

These attributes:

✅ Are never required

---

🚫 NO “IDENTITY-BASED BUSINESS LABELING”

Businesses and institutions inside ROOTED:

❌ May NOT self-identify using:

Racial labels

Political alignment

Religious alignment (outside of explicitly opted-in cultural sets)

Demographic marketing tags

✅ Businesses are surfaced by:

What they do

How they serve

Their story

Their practices

Their trust & safety standing

Their community impact

Not by identity targeting.

✅ STORY OVER SEGMENTATION PRINCIPLE (CORE DOCTRINE)

ROOTED operates under a strict storytelling doctrine:

“Tell us your story.
Show how you serve.
Let the community decide to visit you — not because of labels, but because of trust.”

Discovery must be driven by:

Craft

Ethics

Quality

Education

Service

Environmental care

Community contribution

Not by demographic cues.

🛡️ ENFORCEMENT GUARANTEES

This law is enforced through:

✅ No demographic columns in public discovery schemas

✅ No demographic filters in search, map, or feeds

✅ No demographic sorting in ranking algorithms

✅ No ad targeting by identity

✅ No analytics buckets by identity attributes

Any attempt to introduce demographic profiling:

Is automatically invalid

Must be rejected at code review

Must be blocked at RLS / view level

Must be struck from UI immediately

🧒 CHILD PROTECTION INTERLOCK

Kids Mode receives zero identity-based exposure.

Children:

Are never profiled

Are never segmented by demographics

Are never exposed to identity-driven marketing or labeling

Are only served:

Education

Nature

Agriculture

Culture (opt-in, non-political, non-religious instruction)

🚨 VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

Any actor attempting to introduce profiling systems:

Immediate feature revocation

Immediate discovery removal

Full internal audit

Permanent governance removal

Possible external reporting depending on scope

This applies to:

Admins

Developers

Contractors

Partners

Founders

No one is exempt.

✅ FINAL STATEMENT

ROOTED does not sell identity.
ROOTED does not surface bias.

ROOTED is built for:

Humans

Families

Workers

Farmers

Teachers

Makers

Healers

Builders

Not labels. Not categories. Not markets of identity.
