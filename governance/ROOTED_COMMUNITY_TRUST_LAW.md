🧩 TRUST IS A PREREQUISITE FOR VISIBILITY

No entity may appear publicly in ROOTED unless:

✅ Identity is verifiable
✅ Content is moderated
✅ Status is approved
✅ Account is active
✅ Discoverability is explicitly enabled

There are no “shadow publishes”.

🛡️ MODERATION AS A FIRST-CLASS SYSTEM

All public-facing entities must flow through:

moderation_queue

Including:

Providers

Institutions

Events

Landmarks

Volunteer programs

Community content

No discovery view, feed, map, or search result may surface:

Draft content

Unreviewed content

Rejected content

🧒 CHILD SAFETY SUPERSEDES ALL OTHER PRIORITIES

If any system conflicts with Kids Mode safety:

➡️ Kids safety always wins.

This includes conflicts with:

Revenue

Analytics

Growth

Marketing

Partnerships

🚫 MISUSE OF TRUST

The following permanently ban an entity:

Predatory behavior

Safety manipulation

Fraud

⚖️ FINAL ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY

ROOTED reserves the right to:

## Trauma-Informed Safety Architecture

ROOTED’s safety systems exist specifically to prevent the real-world failures that occur when:

- Family systems collapse
- Institutions fail children
- Communities lose coordination
- Abuse goes structurally unobserved

All design decisions affecting:

- Kids Mode
- Volunteer systems
- Institutions
- Messaging
- Discovery
- Moderation

Must be evaluated through:

✅ Power imbalance analysis  
✅ Consent asymmetry analysis  
✅ Abuse risk modeling  
✅ Child safety precedence  

If any feature increases exploitability, it must be blocked—even if it reduces growth or revenue.
