📜 ROOTED Governance & Ethics

Version: Canonical
Authority Level: Absolute Platform Law
Enforcement: GitHub Governance → Database (RLS + Views + RPCs) → Admin Oversight → UI
Effective Date: First Public Deployment

ROOTED is a civic, community, and institutional operating system governed by explicit consent, safety, and public trust — not monetization-first incentives.

All users, vendors, institutions, developers, administrators, partners, and contractors are legally and ethically bound by this governance.

If any system, code, UI, contract, or business decision conflicts with this document → this document always wins.

🔒 SAFETY RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
❌ No Anonymous Write Access

No unauthenticated or unverified user may:

Create providers

Create events

Post feed items

Submit landmarks

Message other users

Submit RFQs, bids, or bulk offers

All write actions must require:

✅ Verified authentication
✅ Role validation
✅ Tier validation
✅ Feature flag validation
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enforcement

There are no exceptions.

🧒 KIDS MODE — ABSOLUTE PROTECTIONS

When Kids Mode is active, the platform must hard-block all commercial and social risk vectors:

❌ Prices
❌ Sales
❌ Fundraising
❌ Booking
❌ RFQs, bids, subscriptions, or procurement
❌ Commercial advertising
❌ Community uploads
❌ Provider or institution messaging

Additional Hard Rules

Vendors cannot message kids

Institutions cannot target kids

Kids content must be explicitly kids-safe

Kids Mode requires:

✅ Parental PIN

✅ Session timer

Kids Mode is never monetized

Kids Mode overrides all other platform logic

If any conflict arises between child safety and any business goal → child safety always wins.

This clause is permanent and non-negotiable.

🏛️ LANDMARKS ARE ALWAYS NON-COMMERCIAL

Landmarks:

Are educational only

Are never monetized

Can never host:

Pricing

Donations

Ads

Commercial booking

Landmarks cannot be promoted as paid destinations under any circumstances.

🎭 CULTURAL & HOLIDAY PROTECTION
❌ No Default Holiday Activation

ROOTED never infers or auto-assigns:

Culture

Religion

Holidays

All holiday systems are OFF by default

No user or business is auto-enrolled into:

Cultural sets

Religious observances

Seasonal celebrations beyond neutral seasonal themes

✅ Dual Consent for Holiday Activation

For any holiday overlay to appear:

✅ The user must opt-in
✅ The business/provider must opt-in
✅ The date must match the defined holiday window

✅ Triple Consent When Kids Mode is Active

If Kids Mode is ON, ALL three must be true:

✅ User opt-in
✅ Business opt-in
✅ Kids-safe content verification

If any condition fails → fallback to neutral seasonal mode only.

⚖️ PLATFORM ETHICS
ROOTED IS:

✅ Pro-community
✅ Pro-education
✅ Pro-local economy
✅ Pro-institutional access
✅ Pro-safety
✅ Pro-consent
✅ Pro-transparency

ROOTED IS NOT:

❌ Political
❌ Surveillance-based
❌ Data-extractive
❌ Exploitative
❌ Designed to manipulate minors
❌ Designed to monetize crisis, trauma, or emergencies

🐾 SANCTUARY & NON-PROFIT PROTECTION (HARD LAW)

Sanctuaries, rescues, and mission-only nonprofits:

✅ May create volunteer events only
✅ Are kids-safe by default
❌ May never access commercial systems:

Bids

RFQs

Bulk offers

Subscriptions

Paid placements
❌ May never be monetized
❌ May never be algorithmically promoted for profit

These restrictions are structural and non-overridable by admin.

⚙️ NO UNLIMITED POWER PRINCIPLE

Unlogged override authority

Governance laws

✅ ADMIN POWERS MUST BE:

✅ Logged

ROOTED enforces:

✅ User ownership of their data

✅ Transparent analytics only

Nothing becomes public without moderation approval:

Events

(Future) Community uploads

(Future) Experiences

All such submissions:
