📜 ROOTED Governance & Ethics

Version: Canonical
Authority Level: Platform Law
Enforcement: Backend + RLS + Admin Oversight

ROOTED is a civic, community, and institutional operating system governed by explicit consent, safety, and public trust — not by monetization-first incentives.

All users, vendors, institutions, developers, and administrators are bound by this governance.

🔒 SAFETY RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. No Anonymous Write Access

No unauthenticated user may:

Create providers

Create events

Post feed items

Submit landmarks

Message other users

All write actions require:

Verified authentication

Role validation

RLS enforcement

2. Kids Mode Absolute Protections

When Kids Mode is active, the platform must hard-block:

❌ Prices

❌ Sales

❌ Fundraising

❌ Booking

❌ RFQs, bids, subscriptions, or procurement

❌ Commercial advertising

❌ Community uploads

❌ Provider or institution messaging

Additional hard rules:

Vendors cannot message kids

Institutions cannot target kids

Kids content must be explicitly kids-safe

Kids Mode requires parental PIN + session timer

Kids Mode is never monetized

3. Landmarks Are Always Non-Commercial

Landmarks:

Are educational only

Are never monetized

Can never host:

Pricing

Donations

Ads

Commercial booking

Landmarks cannot be promoted as paid destinations.

🎭 CULTURAL & HOLIDAY PROTECTION

ROOTED never infers culture, religion, or holidays by default.

1. No Default Holiday Activation

All holiday systems are OFF by default

No user or business is auto-enrolled into:

Cultural sets

Religious holidays

Seasonal celebrations beyond neutral seasons

2. Dual Consent for Holiday Activation

For any holiday overlay to appear:

✅ The user must opt in
✅ The business/provider must opt in
✅ The date must match the defined holiday window

3. Triple Consent for Kids Mode + Holidays

If Kids Mode is active, ALL THREE of the following are required:

✅ User opt-in
✅ Business opt-in
✅ Kids-safe content verification

If any condition fails → the system falls back to neutral seasonal mode only.

🚨 GOVERNANCE VIOLATIONS

Any person, vendor, institution, developer, or operator who violates ROOTED governance may be subject to:

Feature removal

Account suspension

Permanent platform removal

Legal action if safety, consent, or child protection is violated

There are no exceptions based on revenue, investors, or external pressure.

🧭 GOVERNANCE HIERARCHY

GitHub Governance Files (This Document & Related Law) – Absolute authority

Database RLS + Feature Flags – Technical enforcement

Admin Systems – Human oversight

UI – Display layer only (never authority)

If any layer conflicts:

GitHub law always wins.

✅ ACCEPTANCE

Use of the ROOTED platform constitutes explicit agreement to abide by this governance and ethics framework.
