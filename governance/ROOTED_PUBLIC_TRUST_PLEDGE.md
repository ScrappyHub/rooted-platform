# ROOTED — Public Trust Pledge

ROOTED exists to serve communities, not extract from them.

This pledge explains what you can always expect from ROOTED, no matter how the platform evolves.

## Our Commitments

We commit to building ROOTED as a:

- Calm, non-addictive platform
- Safety-first community system
- Consent-driven discovery network

- Non-extractive civic utility

We do not design for attention capture, behavioral tracking, or emotional manipulation.

## Data & Privacy

- We collect only what is required for platform function.
- We do NOT sell personal data.
- We do NOT build behavioral advertising profiles.
- We do NOT infer personal beliefs, politics, religion, or identity traits.
- Users retain full control over their data subject to safety and legal requirements.

## Kids & Families

- Kids Mode exists by constitutional law, not by preference.
- No monetization exists in Kids Mode.
- No messaging exists in Kids Mode.
- No advertising exists in Kids Mode.
- Educational content is always calm, age-appropriate, and non-directed.

## Sanctuaries & Nonprofits

- Sanctuaries and rescue organizations are permanently protected.
- They may never be monetized.
- They may never be used for profit extraction.
- They exist on ROOTED for education, community, and volunteer coordination only.

## Markets & Monetization

- Markets are gated by governance and role.
- No market is forced on communities.
- No vertical launches exist without safety, compliance, and readiness.
- Staying small is always a valid outcome.

---

## Power & Control

- No individual, admin, or investor has unlimited power.
- All power is bounded by law and audit.
- Silent override is prohibited by design.
- ROOTED is governed by layered authority, not personality.

## Our Promise

ROOTED will always choose:

Safety over speed  
Consent over extraction  
Trust over hype  
Community over virality  

This pledge is not marketing.
It is binding design doctrine.
